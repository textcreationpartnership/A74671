            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N diſpute about <hi>verity</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for <hi>victory,</hi> and in heat of debate to turn to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, is a fault too frequent even among the beſt: I wiſh it were excommunicated, or at leaſt ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>My deſign in this anſwer to Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> his Rejoynder, is (according to my poor talent) to finde out and to clear up truth though clouded and ſullied (I fear) by the duſt raiſed between us (in theſe Polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſcourſes) through miſtake, paſſion, or prejudice on either hand, which as I will not juſtify in my ſelf (being conſcious, the pen is a ſlippery peece, as well as the Tongue)
<pb facs="tcp:120105:3"/>
ſo I cannot approve the ſame in Mr. <hi>H.</hi> who by putting my words upon the wrack, makes them too often ſpeak what he pleaſes, and then condemns mee as malicious? A charge ſo improbable, hee being a perſon unknown to mee; and who before his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder came forth, never did mee any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal wrong, that any indifferent Reader will eaſily clear mee of ſo foul an aſperſion. I confeſſe, I hate his principle of free Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, nor can his Rejoynder extirpate that Antipathy in mee againſt ſuch looſe Doctrine, though I love and honour his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I will not ſay his Rejoynder is a peece of ſcorn and malice (let mee bee rather Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than Active in ſuch kind of Dialect) but ſure I am, hee deals very unbrotherly with mee therein: And therefore (as hee confeſſes in the cloſe) conſidering our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon corruption, he might well expect I ſhould pay him in his own coin.</p>
            <p>But my bleſſed Lord and Maſter hath taught mee, not to return <hi>Evil</hi> for <hi>Evil, Rom. 12. 17, 21.</hi> nor <hi>reviling</hi> for <hi>reviling, 1 Pet. 2. 23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its againſt my mind and deſign, that any Gall or Vineger would drop from my pen; and if any ſuch paſſage have ſlipt mee, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it before hand. What bitterneſs he imputes to mee in my book, ſee anſwered in
<pb facs="tcp:120105:3"/>
their proper places. One paſſage hee takes notice of in my preface. My words are theſe. <hi>When I ſeriouſly conſider his looſe principles held forth to the World in this Treatiſe, with his being ſo exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively favourable to the looſer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner ſort, it makes both my ſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers apt to ſuſpect his practices may poſſibly be as looſe as his principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I am very unwilling to ſpeak what I can by way of juſt Apology for the fore-mentioned expreſſions, till I be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated thereunto. At preſent, let this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> Looſe principles give juſt ſuſpition of looſe practices.</p>
            <p n="2">Yet <hi>2</hi> I did not charge Mr. <hi>H.</hi> with looſe practices.</p>
            <p n="3">Nor <hi>3</hi> Did I ſay, I ſuſpected he was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of looſe Practices; But only, that his looſe principles make me and others <hi>apt</hi> to ſuſpect his practices might poſsibly bee as looſe as his principles. Let the Reader judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther herein I was uncharitable. But to paſs this unpleaſing ſubject, The Reader may pleaſe to take notice, that by divers conceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his Rejoynder, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> yields his cauſe. And <hi>1 By allowing the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of perſons, ipſo jure excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, pa. 21, 22.</hi> For they being <hi>intelligent</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:120105:4"/>
Church-members, and not actually excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, yet lawfully ſuſpended as Mr. H. grants, he muſt needs yield, <hi>that</hi> ſome may be ſuſpended though they be not excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2 By allowing ſelf-ſuſpenſion when a man findes himſelf wicked and living in ſinne; provided hee reſolve to prepare againſt next Sacrament, page 37.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by granting, <hi>That unpreparedneſs may excuſe a man from receiving at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; provided his abſtinence ſerve to humble him, &amp;c. page 246.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſay ſuch a one <hi>muſt</hi> abſtain; Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſays he <hi>may</hi> abſtain. Shall wee contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that which <hi>we</hi> think is a duty, and <hi>he</hi> thinks is lawfull?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3 By aſſerting, that Sacraments can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not convey unto the ſoul any thing that is real, but only that which is relative, pag. 41. And that God ingages not to give man faith by the Sacrament, pag. 171.</hi> If the Sacrament convey nothing <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> then it conveys no inherent Grace, and ſo cannot convert: And if God ingage not to give man faith by the Sacrament, then no man can expect Faith from the Sacrament, and ſo by conſequence, no other grace. Upon which it neceſſarily follows, the Sacrament is no converting Ordinance: and ſo one
<pb facs="tcp:120105:4"/>
great foundation of his free Admiſſion fails him.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4 By allowing a negative ſuſpenſion upon prudential grounds, pag. 82, 83.</hi> Whence it follows, that in ſome caſes hee grants ſuſpenſion of intelligent Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members warrantable. And therefore if he cannot receive it upon our grounds, let us intreat him to accept it upon his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5</hi> By granting, <hi>wee may compel trial of Church-members by way of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm; wherein no man is too old to learn, pag. 60.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And by allowing private Trial upon charitable ſuſpition, pag. 92.</hi> If Church-Officers may try my fitneſs as to point of knowledge, ſurely they may judge of ſuch fitneſs: And if upon trial I bee found ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as that I can neither examine my ſelf, nor diſcern the Lords body, may they not ſuſpend mee till I have gained more knowledge?</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6</hi> By granting, <hi>that a general faith, and acknowledgment of the Goſpel, or Covenant of Jeſus Chriſt as the only means to be ſaved by, is prerequifite to adult Church-memberſhip, and ſo to the Sacraments,</hi> pag. <hi>198.</hi> And, <hi>that the Converſion of aſſent, to beleeve in God,
<pb facs="tcp:120105:5"/>
and Jeſus Chriſt, in oppoſition to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religions is neceſſarily prerequiſite to adult Church-memberſhip, and both the Sacraments. Pag. 209.</hi> Doth it not hence follow</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> That groſly ignorant perſons (who know neither Chriſt, the Goſpel, nor Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) muſt not be admitted.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> That ſuch Perſons are ſcarce ſo much as Church-members.</p>
            <p n="3">And <hi>3</hi> Doth it not follow from all the forementioned Conceſsions, that Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> is a better friend to Suſpenſion than the world takes him to be?</p>
            <p>Withall, I obſerve, that even thoſe who for the ſubſtance agree about Suſpenſion as diſtinct from the greater Excommunication, yet differ about divers circumſtances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: nor are the beſt here, in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, of one mind. Its Vain to expect it, Tyrannicall to exact it, in leſſer matters. As Palates, ſo Judgements are various; that may relliſh mee which hath an ill tang with an other. Oh, that we could bear with, pitty and pray more one for an other, Labouring as much as may be to <hi>Center</hi> in love and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, though the <hi>Lines</hi> of our judgement may in ſome leſſer things be at a diſtance.</p>
            <p>Two Poſitions of mine being the chief grounds of difference between Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:120105:5"/>
my ſelf, and the arguments for proof of each being ſcattered in my Bar fixed, I thought fit to ſum them up together in this place, for the eaſe and ſatisfaction of the Reader.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, That I hold, <hi>The Lords Supper is no converting Ordinance.</hi> My grounds are</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> Becauſe Sacraments preſuppoſe initiall Converſion. Should any perſon deſiring the Sacraments declare before ſufficient witneſs that he would not beleeve in Chriſt, and that he were reſolved to his dying day to live in a known ſinne, what Miniſter could admit ſuch an one either to Baptiſm, or to the Lords Supper? Now that which ever ſuppoſeth Converſion, doth never work Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> Becauſe, I no where finde in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Lords Supper is a ſeed of Regeneration, but a meal or feaſt for nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> Becauſe, there is no promiſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion annexed to the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4</hi> Becauſe, he that eats and drinks unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, eats and drinks damnation or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to himſelf; but hee that is converted by receiving, ſure doth not eat and drink judgement to himſelf, but grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. All theſe laid together ſeem not only
<pb facs="tcp:120105:6"/>
probable, but cogent arguments.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Poſition is, <hi>That no unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſon ought to receive the Lords Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">My grounds for this are, <hi>1</hi> Becauſe, receiving cannot convert, but doth preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice ſuch a one <hi>in ſtatu quo.</hi>

            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> Becauſe, Chriſt forbids ſuch to receive as have fellowſhip with devils, <hi>1 Cor. 10. 20, 21.</hi> But all natural men have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Devils, <hi>Ephe. 2. 2, 3.</hi> and <hi>2 Tim. 2. 26. Ergo.</hi>

            <p n="1">

            <p>Withal, I intreat the Reader to note, that though with us, the rule of receiving be <hi>real worthineſs;</hi> yet, the rule of Admiſſion is <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible worthineſs,</hi> which conſiſts in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledge, profeſſion of piety, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from ſcandal.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:120105:6"/>It may happily bee expected, I ſhould now take Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> to task: but I muſt herein crave to be excuſed, ſince <hi>1</hi> I want leaſure. <hi>2</hi> Love not to ampliate contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. <hi>3</hi> My preſent anſwer to Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey,</hi> if ſolid, will alſo ſubvert Mr. <hi>Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> principles, as to the main.</p>
            <p>When I conſider the zeal and ſtrictneſſe of the Primitive times, (in which a clear difference was put between the <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni,</hi> the <hi>Fideles,</hi> and the <hi>Poenitentes;</hi> of which only the middle ſort received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, though in ſome caſes the Penitents were allowed to ſee the Lords Supper admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, yet might not receive) I fear we ſin on the one hand in point of defect, as their zeal might carry them too far on the other hand in point of exceſſe. In Corporations well ordered, all of the ſame Society have not equal Priviledges; but viſible worth is the gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al foundation of Honour and Truſt: And why it ſhould not be ſo in the beſt of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, I ſee nothing either in Scripture or Reaſon to the contrary.

<pb facs="tcp:120105:7"/>
or weakneſs, hee may bee ſure that is mine, what ever of truth or ſtrength, that's none of mine, but comes from the fountain of all truth and ſtrength. My ſcope in this return to Mr. H. his Rejoynder, is no way to vent my ſpleen againſt Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> upon whoſe head I would heap coals of fire to melt him, not to vex him.</p>
            <p>Yea, in the cloſe of his ſecond Vindication publiſhed this very month, though hee adhere to his former opinion of free Admiſsion, yet page <hi>144.</hi> he expreſſes himſelf with much Candour, in theſe words.</p>
            <p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:120105:9"/>
with griefe, than the managing of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy on either hand, hath contributed to ſatisfie their judgments and conſciences by ſolid convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If in heat of diſpute I have any way tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed (I am aſſured I was far from malice) I ſhall be ready to throw the firſt ſtone at my ſelfe, and bleſſe God who hath given me the opportunity to mend firſt, which once was in Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his hands, before he put forth his Rejoynder. Some ſores are better cured by lenitives then by corroſives.</p>
               <p>Paſſing therefore his reflections upon my ſelfe, in a great part of his Preamble, as extrinſecall to the matter in debate, I obſerve <hi>page</hi> 5. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he ſpeaks in good earneſt, <hi>That unleſſe his Latitude of Admiſſion be allowed, tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences can never have ſolid peace at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Sacraments will ſtill be neglected by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People, ſeparations fomented, human Forms ſet up as neceſſary, &amp;c.

and, <hi>Charges me for paſſing ſentence before conviction.

For his ſecond charge, I hope Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> doth not imagine I made the Title Page firſt, and my Anſwer afterwards; and for a due <hi>Examen,</hi> let the Anſwer it ſelfe ſpeak, whether I took not ſome pains (according to my poor modell) in order to his conviction, before I paſſed a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſentence: The cauſe indeed may ſuffer much by my weakneſs, but I hope it neither then did, nor now ſhall, ſuffer by my wilfull negligence.

And whether <hi>Iudas</hi> received or not, it is not much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall for Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his cauſe, no not in Mr. <hi>Timſons</hi> judgement, in his bar to free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion removed. <hi>pag.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. though otherwiſe a great friend to Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Latitude for Sacramentall receiving.</p>
               <p>In anſwering my 2d. Argument againſt <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> his receiving, he ſaies <hi>Chriſt died for the ſins of the whole world, and ſo for</hi> Judas, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 3.</p>

                  <hi>Aſ.</hi> When Mr. <hi>H.</hi> can prove that by whole world, There, are meant the Reprobate as well as the

Elect, he ſaies ſomthing indeed to invalidate the argument; otherwiſe he doth but ſhuflle. And the Sacrament had been a poor Cordial to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, had it ſeal'd no more to them than it doth to Reprobates. But I ſhall not trouble my ſelf or my Reader with the further vindication of thoſe five Arguments here, as ſtudying all poſſible bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and judging it not material in this buſineſſe, whether <hi>Judas</hi> received or no, what ever weight Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> may lay upon it. But whereas <hi>pag.</hi> 10. He ſaies, <hi>I anſwer thoſe five reaſons my ſelf.</hi> In that he miſtakes. I brought indeed five reaſons to prove <hi>Judas</hi> did not receive; but I brought no reaſon to prove Chriſt denied him the Sacrament, nor do I believe Chriſt did deny him the Sacrament Only by laying open his wickedneſſc, its probable Chriſt did either ſhame him away, or fright him away, or occaſion his going away in a pet; and <hi>Judas</hi> being gone, Chriſt ſpake very comfortably, and applicatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Eleven, which very probably he would not have done without a diſtinction, had the Traytor been preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. 11.

This is ſaid; but not one word of proof brought by Mr. <hi>Humphrey.</hi> 2. Grant it true, he anſwers himſelf, or I may anſwer him with his own words, <hi>I do not value them at the rate of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Its well, we both agree here: I wiſh heartily all Diſputers were of this mind. Here therefore Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> preſſeth <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 23. <hi>They all drank of it.</hi> I anſwered, All is put for all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and twelve for eleven, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 5.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:120105:11"/>
To this Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> returns, <hi>pag.</hi> 11. <hi>If All be put for All preſent, then is it put for the whole twelve, for the twelve ſate down with him, Anſ.</hi> 1. The weakneſſe of this anſwer of Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> will eaſily appeare to a mean capacity. The twelve ſate down with Chriſt, <hi>ergo</hi> the twelve (that is, every of the twelve) received the Lords ſupper. To make out his aſſertion, he muſt prove not only that all the twelve ſate down together, but that they alſo ſtayed all the whiletogether til the Comon-ſupper, the Paſsover, and the Lords Supper were ended. Doth it follow becauſe twelve ſit down together at a Feaſt, therefore they muſt needs all ſit at Table together, or be preſent in the ſame room til all the Courſes be ſerved? we grant <hi>Judas</hi> was preſent at the Common-ſupper; haply alſo he received the Paſsover, which yet ſome doubt; but doth it hence follow, that he was preſent at the Lords ſupper alſo? Is it not ſaid that upon the receiving of the Sop, immediatly <hi>Judas</hi> went out? <hi>John</hi> 13. 30. and that Sop he received at or before the Paſsover; after which, the Lords Supper was inſtituted and adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>To my ſecond, That twelve is here put for eleven, He anſwers, <hi>None that can tell twenty will believe me. Anſ.</hi> 1. Let Mr. <hi>H.</hi> remember his own rule, &amp; a good rule, and ſtand to the judgement of the Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 5. Chriſt after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection appeared to the twelve, but <hi>Judas</hi> was at this time dead, and <hi>Matthias</hi> was not yet choſen in his room; <hi>Ergo,</hi> here twelve is put for eleven. Secondly, this is ordinary, for round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of number: yea in this very caſe, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 17. twelve are put for ten, ſince two of the Apoſtles he ſent before to prepare the Paſsover
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:120105:11"/>
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 16. and, at the evening, himſelfcomes with ten of them, who yet <hi>verſe</hi> 17. are ſaid to be twelve.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> proceeds. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>His argument is this. Becauſe twelve is put for eleven when there were but eleven, therfore twelve muſt be put for eleven, where there was twelve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> What is this but a meer begging of the Queſtion? Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> aſſerts that all the twelve received the Lords Supper. I anſwer, its not affirm'd in Scripture, that the twelve received. 2. Had it been affirmed yet twelve might be put for eleven by roundneſſe of number, as in the former inſtance; to which his finall anſwer is, <hi>I, but there were twelve there,</hi> which is the very queſtion in diſpute between us. By the Law of diſpute (he being opponent, and I reſpondent) he ought to ſolve my diſtinction; and not barely to ſay, but to clear it, that twelve in the buſineſſe of the Lords Supper cannot be underſtood or taken for eleven by roundneſſe of number.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ever acknowledge the force of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> as of every other Scripture: but I deny that <hi>Luke</hi> ſaies, either in terms or by conſequence that <hi>Iudas</hi> was preſent at, or received the Lords Supper, and therefore as yet neither my five Arguments nor 26.

is inverted by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> yet without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the truth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 8. The tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to worſhip the Devill, is the third and laſt, which yet <hi>Luke</hi> makes to be the ſecond and middlemoſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 5.

Here then, in two of the Evangeliſts, there muſt needs be an Hyſterology, without any prejudice to the truth of the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and why not in our buſineſſe alſo? We deny not but thoſe words, <hi>Behold the hand,</hi> &amp;c. were ſpoken at the Table; but it lies upon Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> to prove, that it was the <hi>Lords</hi> Table at that time, when our Saviour uttered thoſe words: We believe it was firſt a Common Table; ſecondly, the Paſchall Table; thirdly, the Lords Table; and that thoſe words were ſpoken by our Saviour when it was a Common Table, or a Paſchall Table, but not when it was the Lords Table; and withall, that <hi>Luke</hi> attended not ſo much upon the order, as the truth of the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>But, ſuppoſe <hi>Judas</hi> was preſent and received, what doth this advantage Mr. <hi>Humphrey He thinks much, becauſe neither Chriſt nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did examine Judas, &amp;c.

And for our bleſſed Saviour; it followes not, becauſe he thought it not neceſſary then to examine the Apoſtles, therefore it is not neceſſary for Church-Officers to examine the people before receiving: Yea, as Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> well notes, in his <hi>Vindiciae ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſionis,</hi> &amp;c. page 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 53. <hi>It is worth the obſerving, that Chriſt did not ſo much as call upon the Jewes in the ſame houſe, to receive the Lords Supper; which he would have done probably, if he had intended it for All; or, for a converting Ordinance.</hi> Chriſt thought it not neceſſary then to admit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary Chriſtians or Women to the Lords Supper, or to put the Apoſtles upon ſelfe-examination before the Lords Supper at this time; is it therefore now not neceſſary that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and particularly women, ſhould be admitted to the Lords Supper? or, is it not neceſſary a man ſhould examine himſelfe before he eat, &amp;c? Muſt Church Officers give an account of their people to God, and muſt they not take an account of their people?</p>
               <p>I added further, That as <hi>Judas</hi> was not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the reſt of the Apoſtles, ſo he had not yet actually betrayed Chriſt, and it is abſurd to puniſh any for a future ſin.</p>
               <p>To this Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> oppoſeth an other paſſage of mine, <hi>page</hi> 102. and then infers, <hi>Chriſt may not keep away</hi> Judas, <hi>becauſe he had not actually betrayed him; but Mr.</hi> Drake <hi>muſt needs keep men away, for fear they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him. Anſ.</hi> 1. Let the Reader take notice, that Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> wrongs my Text, <hi>page</hi> 102. by leaving out a very materiall part of it; the

words are theſe, We keep men away, to prevent certain ſcandall, <hi>by the admiſsion of Perſons vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly unworthy:</hi> Which laſt words of my Text he utterly omits, that thereby my ſenſe may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more ugly: But thoſe words being added, there is no contradiction betwixt Chriſts pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and ours (upon the ſuppoſition that <hi>Judas</hi> did receive) ſince <hi>Judas</hi> was not viſibly unworthy to Chriſt as a Man or Miniſter, but as God; who knew both <hi>Judas</hi> and other hypocrites from the beginning, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 64. yet admitted them as Diſciples: Yet, it followes not thence, the Church ſhould admit ſuch before it have good ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (at leaſt, in the judgment of charity) about their ſincere converſion; otherwiſe the Diſciples did ill to be ſo ſhy of <hi>Saul,</hi> till they had good evidence of his ſincerity from <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 9. 26 27. Chriſt as God, knew by knowledge of viſion, who were unclean and defiled the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: yet, he drove none out, but ſuch as viſibly defiled it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 15. So he knew <hi>Iudas</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy by his divine Omniſcience, but acted not by vertue of that knowledge in point of ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Nor was <hi>Achan</hi> cenſured upon divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, till clear evidence of his theft was produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7. <hi>verſe</hi> 20. to 24. And if Chriſts rule of ſuſpenſion, or other cenſure, be viſible unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, we hope our way and practice is not contradictory to Chriſts rule. 2. We keep not any away barely upon fear, leſt they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray Chriſt (for this fear and jealouſie we may have of divers whom we admit) but, 1. Becauſe they are viſibly unworthy. 2. That we may in the uſe of Gods means, endeavour their fitting againſt the next Sacrament, and they who upon

this account withdraw, ſuſpend themſelves, as refuſing the Ordinance of the Lords Supper, rather then they will accept of it upon a moſt equall and honourable condition.

Whereas therefore Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> is pleaſed to ſay, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 13.</note> that <hi>I ſuſpend, to prevent the ſin men have not committed, and that the ſuppoſal only of future ſin is the very ground of my excommunication.</hi> I am ſorry to ſee him byaſſed by ſo much uncharitableneſſe, when as he knowes, that in theſe cenſures we proceed by the rule of viſible unworthineſſe; and doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with might and main our acting in theſe kinds by the rule of viſibility.

               <p>The following paſſage is ſadder, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us deeply, <hi>as if we gave more power to the Preſbytery in point of ſuſpenſion, then to Jeſus Chriſt the great Maſter of Diſcipline.</hi>

Now my former aſſertion (which he carps at) meddles not with Chriſts power as God, or as Mediator (neither are they any preſidents or rules for our imitation) but only with Chriſts power as a Miniſter. And if Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> be of the minde, that Chriſt as a Miniſter (waving his Divine and Mediatory capacity) might alone be Judge and Witneſſe, and ſuſpend judicially whom he pleaſed, muſt he not of neceſſity alſo yield, that any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Miniſter may do the like?

Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſhall never be able to charge us with keeping any away who are of this temper. As for <hi>Iudas,</hi> though he had made his bargain of betraying Chriſt, yet it was not then ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: Nor did Chriſt (though he knew it well enough) diſcover, that <hi>Iudas</hi> had made any ſuch bargain, but did only foretell that <hi>Iudas</hi> would betray him. However therefore <hi>pag.</hi> 15, &amp; 16. he is pleaſed to charge me <hi>as ſpeaking a very untruth;</hi> a grain of charity might have informed him, that <hi>Iudas</hi> (however he purpoſed, plotted and contracted, all which he knows, or may know, I believe as well as himſelf) yet betrayed not Chriſt, as to the Execution, till he kiſſed him in the Garden. True, in Gods account a purpoſe, plot and contract of evil is an Execution thereof: but civill and Eccleſiaſticall Courts proceed uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by evidence of the fact, not of the purpoſe, plot or contract. I might adde that <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19, 21. 27. our bleſſed Saviour (even after the diſcovery) looks at <hi>Iudas</hi> his betraying him as a future act. In ſome ſenſe therefore, it is a truth that <hi>Iudas</hi> had not betrayed Chriſt. And if ſo, then <hi>I did not ſpeak a very untruth,</hi> in ſaying <hi>Iudas</hi> had not yet betrayed Chriſt, <hi>no more then Peter</hi> had denied him, underſtanding it of the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and compleating act of his Treachery, which Chriſt endeavourd to prevent by the Commination, as well as <hi>Peters</hi> denyall by the Premonition. Beſides, our Saviours diſpenſation here was extraordinary, admitting onely men, Miniſters, Apoſtles, and that without ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation foregoing, which is no rule for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in point of Sacramentall admittance; no more is his admittance of <hi>Iudas,</hi> ſuppoſing he

did receive; And if this ſuppoſition fail, where is Maſter <hi>Humphrey</hi> his ſuperſtructure upon it?</p>
               <p>His upbraiding me again, by comparing Chriſt with the Presbytery, hath been formerly anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Which therefore, with other paſſages of leſſe moment, for brevities ſake I paſſe. I ſhall onely adde this, <hi>Iudas</hi> his treachery (if it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the compleating of it, matter for a Judiciall cognizance, and if Chriſts extraordinary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and diſcovery of it were legall evidence, as Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Even before this, all judgment was committed to Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 22. yet we read not that Chriſt judged any, either Civilly or Eccleſiaſtically, but rather the quite contrary, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 11, &amp; 12. 47.

                  <hi>As for the Queſtion, whether he acted as a Miniſter or Mediator? It is vaine, for he acted as both: He could not inſtitute an Ordinance for his Church, but as he was Head and Mediator, nor could he adminiſter it but as a Miniſter.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If this Queſtion be vain, the more to blame Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> who troubles his Reader with it, eſpecially ſince we both agree Chriſt acted here both as a Mediator and as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I onely diſtinguiſhed between Chriſts acting as a Mediator and as a Miniſter; And added that Chriſt is imitable, not in his acting as a Mediator but as a Miniſter: We doubt not but Chriſt as Mediator, might be both Judge and Witneſſe; But in that he is no pattern for our imitation. If, as a Miniſter, he might be both Judge and Witneſſe, then every Miniſter may be both Judge and Witneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> himſelf here grants Chriſt could not adminiſter the Sacrament but as a Miniſter; Yet, at the ſame time Chriſt was Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. We ſay, Chriſt as Mediator might be both Judge and Witneſſe, but not as a Miniſter: Will he forbid us the ſame liberty of diſtinction hee takes himſelf?</p>
               <p>The other inſtances he excepts againſt, <hi>pag.</hi> 18. of Chriſts adminiſtring it only to Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> prove ſtrongly that all Chriſt did at the Supper, is no neceſſary rule for our imitation: amongſt which <hi>Judas</hi> his Admiſſion (upon Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> his ſuppoſall) being one, falls under the ſame notion; unleſſe Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> can prove that Chriſt did not only admit <hi>Iudas</hi> (a perſon then, as he ſaies, ſcandalous) but alſo with this very intention, that his practice herein might bee a Rule for all Miniſters to the end of the World to admit to the Sacrament ſcandalous perſons. As for his appeal in the cloſe of <hi>pag.</hi> 18, I have ſhewed formerly that Mr. <hi>Timſon,</hi> though his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:120105:17"/>
Second in this cauſe, <hi>looks not at</hi> Judas <hi>his recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or not receiving, as clearly argumentative in this cauſe,</hi> pag. 3, &amp; 4. And ſhould the ſtreſſe of this controverſie lie upon <hi>Iudas</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or his not receiving, at what uncertainties ſhould we be about our practice herein, when it is ſo hard to determine out of Scripture whether <hi>Iudas</hi> received or not.</p>
               <p>His Quotation out of Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> makes not for his purpoſe: We eaſily grant with that learned Clerke, <hi>That Chriſtian profeſſors may lawfully be admitted, though their hearts be full of villany:</hi> and when we have done all we can, ſuch will be admitted. Where we find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of knowledge, profeſſed ſubjection to all the waies of Chriſt, not contradicted by a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous life, we bleſſe God for the good we ſee in them, cheerfully give them the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, leaving their hearts and inward condition to Gods Judgement. For that other worthy Gentleman he quotes in the end of this Section; I have ſome reaſon to believe (what ever may bee his judgement about <hi>Iudas</hi> his receiving) he is not of Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Latitude for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Sacrament.</p>

Let me
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:120105:19"/>
(to evidence the abſurdity of this inſtance of his) inlarge it a little: As Chriſt did not ſuſpend, ſo he did not excommunicate <hi>Juaas,</hi> nor ſend to the High Prieſts or Officers for evidence againſt him, though he were <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate for the fouleſt treaſon that ever the Sun beheld, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Church muſt not excommunicate actually the vileſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of men, though never ſo clearly convicted by evidence of the fact; or at leaſt, they do not ſin in not excommunicating them, becauſe Chriſt did not think fit to excommunicate <hi>Judas</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, who was <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate. See whither an ingagement in looſe principles will not drive men!

                  <hi>As to the Church or Miniſter, I held, &amp; do hold, that all Church-members, that are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unintelligent, nor excommunicate, ought freely to be admitted to this Ordinance: ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Spirituall and Temporall prudence being conſidered.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Doth it not hence cleerly follow, that the ſuſpenſion of perſons, <hi>jure</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, is but a caſe of prudence: and if ſo, then we ſhould plead for the ſuſpenſion of others (who are viſibly unworthy) only as a caſe of prudence too. Nay, 2ly. will it not follow hence, that the excommunication of perſons, <hi>jure</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, is but a caſe of prudence too, the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of women to the Sacrament, &amp;c. is but a caſe of prudence too. I believe Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> will finde at laſt, that ſuch caſes of prudence, are good caſes of conſcience, it being the moſt prudentiall (as well as conſcientious) way, to ſubmit to all the commands of Chriſt, whether they be in expreſſe termes, or by good conſequence laid upon us in the Scripture. In the ſame page he comes to my Exceptions: the firſt, that Infants and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted (as deaf perſons) are to come to the Word, therefore they are not uncapable of the Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>For the deaf, he ſpeaks mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly well; for Infants, they were better keep at home, but only for the ſake of them that tend them: His Text,</hi> Deut. 29. <hi>&amp;c. is good to prove their Covenanting by their Parents in Baptiſme, where there is only a paſsive reception, and the benefits relative; but as to the Ordinance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, it muſt be actuall, and they are uncapable of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:120105:20"/>
any reall work by it. Anſ.</hi> 1. Saving the jeſt, which Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> can break miraculouſly well, my diſcourſe, <hi>page</hi> 13. and 14. ſpeaks no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any miraculous working, farther then every work of converſion is miraculous, &amp; indeed a far greater miracle then all miraculous cures upon the body, <hi>John</hi> 14. 12. The working upon Infants and deaf perſons at the Word (I do not ſay by the Word) upon blind and paralytick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at the Lords Supper, may be extraordinary; but no more miraculous, then is the working upon perſons at age, and who have their ſenſes perfect. No Ordinance is a naturall, but only a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inſtrument of converſion, which God uſeth arbitrarily, and can, when he pleaſeth, work without them. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>I do not ſay this is all God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, but this is the leaſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</hi>
                  </note> That, God requires of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is either active or paſſive preſence; that I ſhould either preſent my ſelfe, or be preſented before the Lord, according to my capacity. The Ordinances have an aptitude to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, offer, or ſeal, and (when ſpecially elevated by divine benediction) to apply Chriſt, &amp; grace either initiall or progreſſive (all of them, the latter; ſome of them, the former alſo) to any Church-member, whether he have an active, or only a paſſive capacity. Thus Infants ſanctified from their mothers womb, may, at the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſme, at leaſt have further degrees of grace infuſed; and that God, who infuſes grace into ſome of them before any Ordinance uſed, can infuſe more grace upon the uſe of any Ordinance, though the Infant be no more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of progreſſive, then of initiall grace, or of the Ordinance, by, or at which, it is wrought. Gods operation upon Infants &amp; others, naturally
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:120105:20"/>
uncapable, are ſecret; the creatures worke is to get in the way and road of grace, that the very ſhadow of mercy paſſing by, may overſhadow ſome of them. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 15. If I be in the way of mercy, who knowes but it may ſpread a skirt over me, and make it a time of love, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. A beggar bringing his babe to a rich mans gate, may obtain, not only ſtrong meat for himſelfe, but milk for his babe, though it be not ſenſible of the benefit, or how it comes by it.</p>
               <p>The places I quoted are not ſo ſlight, to prove Infants muſt be preſent at the Word, Read, or Preached &amp;c. as he would make them. True, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 11, 12. they were before God to enter into Covenant: But <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. <hi>verſe</hi> 11, 12. they were to be preſented before God in ordinary, at the great anniverſary feaſts; <hi>that they might hear,</hi> &amp;c. and while Infants are but preſent, God can teach them, though man cannot, <hi>Jeſh</hi> 8. 35. eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word was read before the little ones, as well as others, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 13. In a day of humiliation, their little ones were preſented before the Lord as well as others: And, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 16. the very ſame thing is commanded; and to take away all cavill about their age, they are expreſly noted to be ſuch little ones, as ſuck the breaſts. What though they underſtand nothing? cannot that God, who bids us preſent them before him, lay his hands upon their hearts, and bleſſe them at his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. As God teacheth many elder perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly, whom he doth not teach ſavingly; ſo he can teach infants ſavingly, whom he doth not teach convincingly, namely, by infuſing ſaving knowledge and grace, <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 13. May not they be comprehended by Chriſt at the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:120105:21"/>
who cannot at all comprehend him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. Before I paſſe, I ſhall only note that, about Infant-Baptiſme. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſpeaks ambiguouſly, yet ſeemes to hint, as if the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Baptiſme to infants were only relative and not abſolute; which if I were certain of, I had more to ſay to him, but till then, I forbear. I ſhall only add this, that however Infants may be uncapable of any reall work <hi>[by]</hi> hearing, yet, they are not uncapable of a reall work <hi>[at]</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Had Chriſt bid an Infant ſtretch out his withered hand, his Almighty power at the ſame time might both have cured him, and alſo acted him to ſtretch forth the ſame hand, being cured, although the Babe underſtood not one word Chriſt ſpake. And cannot Chriſt cure an Infants withered ſoul, as well as his withered body, though the Babe underſtand nothing of the word of command in either.</p>

tearmes; but by Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his leave, the Reader might eaſily have been abuſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſecond exception above mentioned to be either my own termes, or at leaſt my ſenſe: My words are theſe, <q rend="inline">I ask Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> why are Infants capable of Baptiſme, and not of the Lords Supper? If he ſay, becauſe they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themſelves nor diſcern the Lords Body, &amp;c.</q> then I anſwer, no more can groſly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perſons, &amp;c. To this, Mr. <hi>Humphrey, Sir, you muſt excuſe me, I ſhall not anſwer you alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo; but, becauſe Infants are really unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, in Baptiſme, there is required only a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, but in the Lords Supper, an actuall recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 2ly. <hi>Becauſe it is not their duty to examine themſelves, and diſcern the Lords Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> To omit the abſurd oppoſition of <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> to <hi>paſsive</hi> (which haply was an errour only of the Preſſe) are not Infants naturally uncapable of Baptiſme as well as of the Lords Supper? Do they, or can they apprehend any more, either of the Signe, or thing fignified, in Baptiſme, then the Lords Supper? Or, in Baptiſme, is there only a paſſive reception required? True, in Infants, God requires only a paſſive reception, becauſe they have no active capacity at preſent: But in Elder perſons Baptized, God expects an active, and not only a paſſive reception; namely, the acting of faith, to receive the blood of ſprinkling, and an active indeavour (eſpecially at the time of Baptiſme) to mortifie ſin, and riſe up to newneſſe of life, beſides the profeſſion of their faith in their own perſons; none of which, either God or man, expects of Infants, whom yet the efficacy of Baptiſme may reach, as well as Elder
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:120105:22"/>
perſons, though it be not limited to this or that time; nor doth the Baptiſme of the Holy Ghoſt, alwaies accompany the Baptiſme of Water, either in Infants or in Elder perſons. In Elder perſons then Baptized, there is not only a paſſive, but an active reception, as at the Lords Supper there is not only an active, but a paſſive reception. For his ſecond Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe it is not the duty of Infants to examine themſelves, and diſcern the Lords Body. Anſ.</hi> No more is it the duty of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to examine themſelves, at, or before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, or to diſcern the blood of Chriſt, and the water of the Spirit repreſented thereby. &amp;c. which Elder perſons baptized are bound to, and ſin if they do not; yet, I hope this naturall uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Infants, in order to examination &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion is no bar to their baptizing; therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame account (I argue now <hi>ad hominem</hi>) they are no juſt bar to Infants receiving the Lords Supper. If therefore I ſhould ſay, God requires ſelfe-examination, and diſcerning the Lords Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Elder perſons, but not of Infants, would it not follow, that Infants might better be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lords Supper, then Elder perſons that are groſly ignorant, ſince there is not that danger of unworthy receiving, in Infants, as in Elder perſons, and that becauſe the abſence of examination and diſcretion in them, makes them, <hi>co nomine,</hi> unworthy; not ſo in Infants, becauſe God requires not thoſe acts of them as condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to make them evangelically worthy. Might I not here retort Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his own argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon himſelfe, <hi>The Apoſtle ſaies, Let a man examine himſelfe, and ſo eat. He doth not ſay, Let him not eat, unleſſe he can and do examine
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:120105:22"/>
himſelfe:</hi> ſhould I add, that the Jewiſh Children ate the Paſſover, yet were naturally uncapable of it, as ours are of the Lords Supper. And further, that Children are Diſciples as well as Elder per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that the Diſciples aſſembled together to break bread, <hi>Acts</hi> 20 7. (by which argument principally, we prove, women may, and ought, to receive) I might thereby not only diſcover the weakneſs of his two forementioned Reaſons, but haply alſo might make him a Proſelyte to Infant-receiving. And its a Queſtion, whether a Miniſter might not with more comfort admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter either Sacrament to an Infant, than to a groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant or ſcandalous perſon, who either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly or really rejects the Covenant ſealed and exhibited by thoſe ſignes. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> might very well therefore have ſpared thoſe words, <hi>page</hi> 25. <hi>If the man had not been too ſlighting of me, he would never have run himſelfe into the contempt of ſo many repetitions of this Infant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: I will reckon them as I go, here is one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I hope the Lord hath learned me to ſlight no man, much leſſe a Miniſter: But its an hard matter, that I cannot preſſe an argument, which to me ſeemes ſolid (I have now demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated there is more weight in it, then Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> was aware of) but I muſt preſently be judged as ſlighting the perſon of my Opponent. I wiſh Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> would lay his hand upon his heart, and ſadly conſider, whether his bitter ſcoffs do not ſmell rather of ſlighting, then my frequent preſſing of this, or any other argument. If the argument be valid, it cannot be too often preſſed, and I am confident, I preſſe it no where, but where Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> puts me
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:120105:23"/>
upon it. Let me be good at Weight, and I ſhall not envy his being good at Number. I hope his reckonings will bring me in a good ſhot in the iſſue. His reckonings with me ſhall learn me I truſt to make the more frequent and ſtrict recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> having granted that perſons <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate, may be ſuſpended, addes theſe words. <hi>If you ſhall demand of me a ſubflan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall proof for yielding thus much, I muſt anſwer you, the Church is of age, ask it.

               <p>Mr. Humphrey, <hi>If we muſt hold the Sacrament to be a means of grace only to the Regenerate, and that none may come without theſe Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall graces, &amp;c. we cannot approach this holy Table, but the terrours of the Lord muſt fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, as trembling to be guilty of the blood of Chriſt, and eat our own damnation. The beſt of Gods people (who are moſt apt to queſtion their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eſtates) will be diſcouraged; and others, upon ſleight tryall, will conclude their eſtate to be good, preſume upon the Sacrament, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bring upon themſelves ſecurity, and the blood of their own ſouls, &amp;c.</hi> This I take to be the ſubſtance of <hi>page</hi> 29. and 30. The caſe is very ſerious, and pathetically propounded.</p>
               <p n="1,2,3">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We all agree (from expreſſe teſtimony of Scripture) that they who receive unworthily, eat and drink judgment to themſelves, and are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 2ly. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> is not ignorant of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold unworthineſſe (as well as worthineſſe) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:120105:26"/>
generally by our Divines; <hi>viz.</hi> the unworthineſſe of Perſon, and of Preparation, and that either of theſe unworthineſſes make a man obnoxious to the forementioned guilt and danger. 3ly. Its confeſt that hypocrites may be very confident, and true <hi>Nathaniels</hi> may doubt very much they have neither the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of perſon nor preparation; or through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, ſloth, and negligence, may faile very much in point of preparation, yet have the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of Perſon.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. We muſt diſtinguiſh between the rigour of the rule, as laid down doctrinally, and the equity of the rule as reduced to practice. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this by the Law of the Paſſeover: the rigid rule was, no unclean perſon ſhould eat thereof; yet, it might fall out, that many unclean perſons did eat thereof, and that without blame or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, provided they were not ſupinely negligent either in avoiding or ſearching out their unclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Otherwiſe no man durſt have eaten the Paſsover, ſince its poſſible he might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed though unwittingly.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. Abſtinence from the Sacrament is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold 1. Out of profaneſſe and ſlighting of Chriſt, and his grace. 2ly. Out of clear conviction or grounded jealouſie about our ſpirituall eſtate. In like manner, Receiving of the Sacrament is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. 1. Out of Cuſtom or other ſiniſter reſpects. 2ly. Out of Conſcience rightly informed (about truth of grace inherent) or deceived and miſtaken, or doubting and ſcrupulous; namely, when it cannot clearly either aſſent or diſſent: Or when it inclines in aſſent to the better part; yet with fear and jealouſie of the contrary.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:120105:26"/>
Theſe things premiſed we ſay. 1. That for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons totally deſtitute of the worthineſſe of perſon, (ſuch are all in their natural condition) it were happy if the terrours of the Lord were more upon them that by fear of murthering Chriſt, they might be kept from murthering Chriſt, at the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. If upon tryall, an erring conſcience tell them they have truth of grace, they are expoſed to a ſnare whether they receive or not: ſince if they come not, they ſin againſt their conſciences; and if they come, they receive unworthily, and thereby contract guilt and incur danger; as it is in other caſes, when an erring conſcience puts a man upon ſin as duty, or pulls a man from duty as ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. If any doubt of truth of grace (be the ground of his miſtake right or wrong) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fear to receive 1. this abſtinence of his, is far from a ſlighting of Chriſt. 2ly. cannot bee prejudiciall, but advantagious to his ſoul, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hee ſit not down in a doubting and deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent condition.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. A true <hi>Nathaniel</hi> wanting evidence, and ſo fearing to aproach is by the Sacrament put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to be more diligent in making his calling and Election ſure: And by ſelf-examination, backt with prayer and advice of experienced Miniſters and Chriſtians, may through the bleſſing of God attain ſuch a meaſure of evidence, as that he may with comfort approach the Lords Table, and go away with a double Portion of the ſpirit of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and for ſuch in ſpeciall, the Sacrament was inſtituted as a Cordiall to refreſh their faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearts, and as a ſeale to ratifie the Covenant of grace, and to put it out of queſtion to their conſciences. So that if we be rightly underſtood,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:120105:27"/>
here is no ſadning of thoſe whom God would not have made ſad nor any ſtrengthing the hands of the wicked on the other ſide: And for thoſe whoſe portion is ſorrow, they had better be in the houſe of mourning then in the houſe of feaſting. As for the Objection Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> moves from <hi>Rom</hi> 14. laſt: <hi>He that doubteth is Damned, if he eat</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I think Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> is miſtaken in ſaying Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks but lowly of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. I conceive its no low ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to call the <hi>Manna</hi> ſpirituall meat, the miraculous Water, ſpirituall Drink; and the Rock (out of which it flowed) Chriſt. And though both <hi>Manna</hi> and Water were common,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:120105:27"/>
(they all ate and drank thereof) this is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing of either, ſince the choiſeſt mercies are moſt common, at leaſt as to the tender of them: (witneſſe God himſelf) eſpecially in the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Whether the Apoſtle intended here to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Sacrament above other Ordinances (which to me ſeems probable,) or not: I believe it excells other Ordinances; And that becauſe it is made up of them all, to wit, the Signe, the thing ſignified, the word &amp; prayer; beſides the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation it hath by our bleſſed Saviours inſtitution at ſuch a time, and for ſuch high ends. And if all theſe Ordinances combined, are better then any one of them ſingle; ſurely the Sacrament muſt have the preheminency.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Upon the ſame account, inſtituted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip excells naturall worſhip, becauſe it includes it, and ſuperadds inſtitution. Particularly faith in the Mediator is inſtituted worſhip; yet I hope it is not inferiour to naturall worſhip, which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, and ſuperaddes Inſtitution. There is no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance but hath its peculiar uſe and excellency, for which wee have cauſe to bleſſe God and be thankfull; nor need we trouble our ſelves with compariſons of this kind, which are for the moſt part curious, and too often odious. Yet, were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all receiving a converting Ordinance, I think wee might wel honour it as the Crowning Ordinance, ſince it excells in point of Confirmation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents Chriſt effectually to ſo many ſenſes: but I forbear.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Humphrey.</hi> Pag. 32, &amp; 33. <hi>Here is a Church-ſinne; that ſin is making that common

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Why ſhould Circumciſion be a ſeal, and not every other Sacrament, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the Lords Supper?</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Hath it not the Office of a Seal in ratifying the Covenant of grace as well as other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. How doth the unworthy Receiver eat and drinkjudgement, unleſſe this Sacrament by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſignes applied (as in ſealing there is Firſt a ſigne; Secondly, Application thereof; Thirdly, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification thereby) ratifie judgement to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance?</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> forgets himſelf in ſaying Remembrance is only of things paſt; otherwiſe how can I remember the Sabbath to ſanctifie it, or remember my latter end? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5ly. Why ſhould not this Sacrament be a ſigne of future things as well as other Sacraments? Circumciſion and the Paſsover were ſignes of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:120105:28"/>
things. Baptiſm is a ſigne of future things; Namely, of Regeneration, Mortification and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vification, which (in moſt baptiſed perſons that attain them) are future: and why ſhould not the Lords Supper be a ſigne of future, as well as of paſt things (eſpecially upon Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who makes it a converting Ordinance)? Is not the comming of Chriſt future, and how can this Sacrament declare Chriſts death till hee come, and not remember the receivers of Chriſts comming that is future, as well as of Chriſts death that is paſt? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. Pag. 34. <hi>In opening, what is this eating and drinking unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily; he diſtinguiſhes between a worthy Receiver and receiving worthily. This laſt he places main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in comming with Reverence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I deny not but Reverence is a part of worthy receiving, and that he who receives ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverently, receives unworthily with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Yet as it is competible to a naturall man, he makes it lie very much, in fearing his own Damnation, which (grant it be a duty <hi>in ſtatu quo</hi>) being but ſlaviſh fear, is no part of Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call worthineſſe; and therefore cannot be a main part of receiving worthily. Its ſuch a worthineſſe, as he that hath commited the ſin againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt may receive with.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. If further by reverence he mean, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward awe, and outward demure behaviour, its a very eaſie matter to receive worthily, yea though a man neither have truth of grace, nor make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience either of examining or preparing himſelf. Certainly when the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Let a man exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf, and ſo let him eat,</hi> &amp;c. he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:120105:29"/>
that who ever of age received without ſelf-examination received unworthily; but Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> tells us, the main of receiving worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, lies in reverence; and this reverence a naturall man may have, and receive with; yet never ſo much as examine himſelf. From ſuch worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, good Lord deliver me. Not but that I think this reverence is neceſſary, but it falls infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſhort of receiving worthily, and he that receives no more worthily, will eat and drink damnation to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. If receiving worthily lie mainly in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, then it doth not lie mainly in the acting of Faith, Love, Hungring and thirſting after Chriſt, Evangelicall repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which how abſurd and contrary, not only to the conſent of Orthodox Divines, but chiefly of the Scripture it ſelf, which placeth Evangelicall worthineſſe in cloſing with Chriſt, and unworthineſſe in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of him, and withdrawing from him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 3, 4,5. &amp; 22. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 45, 46. Such cold, looſe, and jejune interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may well make cold and looſe Chriſtians, but will contribute poorly in order to receiving worthily.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 35.</note> 
                  <hi>What is the meaning of that phraſe, not diſcerning the Lords Body? Is it the not putting a difference between this Sacred, and a common Table: When men have no more reſpect to this Bread and Wine then to their ordinary meates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. By way of conceſſion; this is a groſſe breach of the rule indeed, and which groſly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant perſons are very ſubject to. This groſſe ſin we ſhould endeavour to prevent by Sacramentall tryall, and inſtruction of the Ignorant, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:120105:29"/>
our care herein find little favour in Mr <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> his eies.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. The very laying open of the ſin, in the Text, imports a contrary duty of diſcerning the Lord Body, if we would receive worthily: and this lies not barely in hiſtoricall faith, diſcerning the Elements to be holy in uſe, though common in nature; and that the Lords Body is diſtinct from them though united Sacramentally with them; but principally in the diſcretion of ſaving faith and love (words of knowledge in Scripture being put for acts of the will and affections) whereby the Heavenly Eagles, diſcerning the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, fly to it, and feed upon it; the diſcretion of taſt being held forth in the Sacrament as well as the diſcretion of ſight; and otherwiſe what is our diſcerning of the Lords Body more then a Devill may do? Intellectuall diſcretion without cordial diſcretion, is ſo far from being a main part of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving worthily, that without this latter, it doth but aggravate our ſin, and increaſe our doom. Let my ſoule never reſt, nor pleaſe it ſelfe in ſuch diſcerning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>The Apoſtle enquires not into the ſtate of the perſon, whether regenerate or not, but lookes to their manner of receiving,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. But doth he not put them upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into their own eſtates? What elſe is meant by that precept; Let a man examine himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let the Apoſtle interpret himſelf. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4. And when is there a fitter time to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine my eſtate, actions, growth; then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after a Sabbath or Sacrament? Sabbath daies being with them Sacrament daies?</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. If they muſt look to the manner of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:120105:30"/>
muſt they not then ſee to it, they receive graciouſly; and what was either their receiving, or remembring Chriſts death (as to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular good and comfort) if they did not both in a right manner? 3ly. Can we be ſo uncharitable as to imagine, they came not to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as a memoriall of Chriſt? Could they either name or receive the Lords Supper, and at the ſame time utterly forget the Lord, whoſe Supper it was, and look at it only as a common Supper?</p>
               <p>Mr. Humph. <hi>If the meaning of either of the phraſes were, to come without faith or regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as ſome too harſhly preſſe it) then the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians that were puniſh'd for this ſin, muſt have been not only chaſtened, but condemned with the world, which they were not, verſe</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Its probable, divers of them did come without faith and regeneration (many of every Congregation being in their naturall condition, and under impenitency, which the Apoſtle hints of the Corinthians in particular, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. laſt, and 13. 5. compared) yet it followes not, they were condemned with the world, ſince they might repent in their ſickneſſe, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle preſcribes, <hi>verſe</hi> 31. as the remedy. 2ly. Even the godly amongſt them might haply come pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely, though they made it not a common Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and undoubtedly to theſe. God gave repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before their death. His argument then is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak, to conclude their damnation from their unworthy receiving. They indeed who repented not, were damned; but there is no connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween any mans ſin and his damnation, unleſſe that ſin be accompanyed with finall impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. 3ly. If it be harſh to ſay, that they who
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:120105:30"/>
come without faith and regeneration, receive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily when it's delivered only <hi>in theſi,</hi> how harſh is it to charge a Church <hi>in hypotheſi,</hi> with ſuch high profanneſſe, that they received the Lords Supper but as a common Supper, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as remembred Chriſt in it, who is both the Author, Matter, and End of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whoſe Name in an ſpeciall manner is called upon it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 36. Mr. Humphrey <hi>opens that expreſsion, of being guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and grants, that unworthy receivers contract this guilt, by offering an indignity to the thing ſignified: but he approves not that harſher lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of murthering Chriſt. Anſ.</hi> 1. Whether he that is guilty of blood be not a murtherer. 2ly. Whether degrees of murther vary the kinde. 3ly. Whether in murther all be not principals. 4ly. Why ſhould ſleighting of Chriſt in Apoſtates be murther, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. and 10. and not in unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receivers? If ſleighting my Brother be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhall ſlighting my Saviour be no murther? The leaſt murther is murther as well as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. This language therefore, by Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his leave, is not harſh, unleſſe it be harſh to call a Spade a Spade.</p>

To his ſecond caution I ſhal only add thus much, That whoſoever upon tryall, is truly ſenſible of, and grieved for, the want of grace; humbled under, and reſolved againſt, ſin: this man hath truth of grace at preſent, and is the worthyeſt communicant in Gods account. In his third caution, <hi>he grants, that in order to better

preparation againſt the next Sacrament, a wicked man may abſtain at preſent; but if he reſolve to go on in ſin, then he is bound to come and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply damnation to himſelfe, unleſſe he repent.</hi>

The diſtinction being thus cleared and ſtated, I believe that every unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiver doth ſeal his own damnation really, whether he mind what he doth, or no.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. That if ſuch a perſon <hi>in ſtatu quo,</hi> will venture to receive, he ought to ſeal and apply to himſelf onely his own portion which is Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion otherwiſe he were bound to ſeal a falſity.</p>
               <p n="3">But thirdly, that any man is bound to receive for this very end, that he may ſeal his own Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; I deſire a <hi>ſcriptum eſt</hi> from Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey.</hi> Certainly, were this a duty, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were more neceſſary for perſons either <hi>de jure,</hi> or <hi>facto</hi> excommunicate then for any other: The proudeſt ſinners have moſt need of ſealing their own Damnation, that thereby they might be driven to humiliation and repentance.</p>
               <p>The comfort of poor ſouls, (who being ſenſible of their unworthineſſe, fear their Damnation,) is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:120105:32"/>
ſealed and cannot be reverſed, lies in this. 1. That the ſealing in the Sacrament is not according to their Apprehenſion, but according unto Truth. Let men think themſelves never ſo unworthy, if they be Evangelically worthy, not their Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation but their Salvation is ſealed. 2ly. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Damnation be ſealed, its ſealed but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, as to the Event, however it may bee ſealed abſolutely, as to their preſent State. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they keep not the condition of Damnation, the ſealing thereof ſhall no more prejudice them then the ſealing of Salvation ſhall advantage Hypocrites, who keep not the condition of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. His diſtinction of <hi>Actuall</hi> and <hi>Potentiall</hi> ſealing is not ſo accurate, ſince every receiver doth actually ſeal both parts of the Covenant, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both Salvation and Damnation only the one he ſeales abſolutely, the other conditionally, according to his particular ſtate and continuance therein. Only the worthy Receiver hath this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular advantage, That his Salvation is ſealed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, both as to State and Event; not ſo the Damnation of the unworthy Receiver, I mean as to the latter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>If the Sacrament be a Seal, it doth exhibite and convey ſomthing to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver; and that, to the Unregenerate, muſt bee dangerous. Here then let us know and arm our ſelves, that Sacraments being only moral Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cannot convey any thing that is Real unto the Soul by way of Obſignation; but onely that which is Relative, making no change, but as to our Eſtates, and Relations to God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If the Sacrament being only a Morall Inſtrument, cannot convey any thing that is reall,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:120105:33"/>
then the Word being alſo but a Morall Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot convey any thing that is Reall. The Word Preached, may work Knowledge phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically, but it cannot work grace phyſically. Hee that looks at any Ordinance under Chriſt, as more then a Morall Inſtrument of Grace, doth at once debaſe God, and Idolize the Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. If Sacraments can convey nothing Reall and abſolute but onely Relative, then Sacraments cannot convert and regenerate; theſe being Real &amp; abſolute priviledges, as Juſtification and Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are Relative priviledges; (not to ſtand upon his oppoſition of Reall to Relative, as if a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate were not a Real ſtate.)</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Suppoſe they could convey no Real thing to the Soul by way of Obſignation yet they may by way of Signification. The Sacrament is a Signe as well as a Seal, and preaches Chriſt crucified to the eie, as the Word doth to the ear.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. As a Seal conveies an Eſtate to him that keeps the Conditions of a Covenant for Eſtate; ſo the Sacrament conveies degrees of Grace to him that keeps the condition of the Covenant. True, the Seal is nothing without the Writing, for it muſt have ſome what to ſeal to; and that is the Covenant: but, as annexed to the Covenant, it makes a compleat Inſtrument, and doth not only ſignifie, but alſo <hi>convey Chriſt</hi> with all his benefits to the worthy Receiver: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>That is, gives a Title to Chriſt, as by exhibiting, it gives poſſeſſion in part.</hi>
                  </note> and if ſo, then not onely Relative, but alſo reall and abſolute Priviledges: namely, more degrees of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well as further evidence of Juſtification and Adoption. The Iron therefore hee complaines of, <hi>pag.</hi> 41. will ſtill ſtick in his Soul, ſince neither word nor Sacrament convey either wrath or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:120105:33"/>
mercy Phyſically, but only Morally: Both repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by way of Signification, which if the ſpirit pleaſe to ſet on effectually, may contribute much in their ſeverall kinds; but the Sacraments excell in way of Obſignation and Ratification.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The terme <hi>Paſſover,</hi> is not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in my Text, quoted by Mr. <hi>Humphrey, page</hi> 19. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Had I ſaid, that all unclean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were not only to be ſuſpended in generall, but in particular to be ſuſpended the Paſſover, had it been any more then the truth? I would not here be miſtaken, as if I thought that either Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or Leviticall uncleanneſſe did exclude from all Ordinances, but only from ſome Ordinances; and that both under the Legall and Evangelicall diſpenſation. Amongſt which, I apprehend that the Paſſover then, and the Lords Supper now, are in a ſpeciall manner diſtinguiſhing and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Ordinances. This I have in part made out
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:120105:34"/>
here, and ſhall, by Gods aſſiſtance, clear it more hereafter, in its proper place. 3<hi>ly.</hi> I brought not that place, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 19. to prove it in termes, but by conſequence. The Reſurrection is not in termes in theſe words, <hi>I am the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, and Jacob;</hi> yet, thoſe words prove the Reſurrection ſtrongly. From the fore-quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place its evident, that unclean perſons were to be kept from thoſe holy things, which were inſtituted for meat's of Edification, not of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. I aſſume: But the Paſſover was ſuch an holy thing; therefore they were to be kept from the Paſſover. 4<hi>ly.</hi> As the terme <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> is not named here, ſo the terme <hi>Excommunication</hi> is not mentioned, either in the Old or New-Teſtament: Doth it follow therefore, that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion cannot be proved by this Text, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication by Scripture? Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> can conclude, we ſuſpend thoſe perſons whom we do not admit, and can he not as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>Jchofada</hi> ſuſpended thoſe perſons whom he did not admit? 5<hi>ly.</hi> Let me retort a paſſage of his Anſwer in this page, changing only the terme of <hi>Leviticall</hi> for <hi>Morall: Is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the Levites at ſuch a time, did, or could, in ſuch a concourſe, try, and examine them concerning</hi> Leviticall <hi>cleanneſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe?</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> tell me, how they could try all for Leviticall uncleanneſſe; and I will tell him, how they could try all for Morall uncleanneſſe. I avouch not, <hi>page</hi> 202. that an excommunicated perſon might come into the Temple; but into the Church, where preſence doth not defile. And as for the Publican, his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice did not make him unclean, nor did <hi>John the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:120105:35"/>
Baptiſt</hi> bid them renounce the Office, but be juſt and righteous in their places, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 12, 13. Indeed generally, Fublicans were very oppreſſive and hatefull, but their Office was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and therefore upon that account ſolely, they could not be kept out of the Temple, I mean the Court for the people. But it followes not, that becauſe Publicans, as ſo, might not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Temple, therefore when morally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, by horrid oppreſſions, &amp;c. they might not be kept out.</p>
               <p>For my ſecond Exception, about Children ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Paſſover, it ſeems probable enough, that Children who were capable of eating fleſh, and could conveniently be brought up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did eat of it; from that generall Precept, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48. nor doth Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> deny it, though he ſeem more inclinable to the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This granted, makes much againſt Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey,</hi> his excepting Children from the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Since therefore he will needs be ſcoring, let him toke notice of it, as a probable evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelfe.</p>
               <p>He doth well in paſſing over my inſtance of <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> Paſſover, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. <hi>verſe</hi> 18, 19, 20. which proves, that Morall uncleanneſſe made them more uncapable of it, then Leviticall pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, God accepting thoſe who ſet their hearts aright, though they were not cleanſed after the purification of the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>D. Dr.</hi> Excommunication was a bar to the Paſſover, and this was for ſcandalous ſins, not Levitical pollutions.</p>

                     <hi>Page</hi> 46.</note> 
                  <hi>Who will not be willing to grant this in the main? But what followes then?
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:120105:35"/>
only, as I hold, that men muſt be firſt excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, before they be kept from the Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Take notice, that Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> grants excommunication is a bar to the Paſſover. Now I would intreat him to give me but one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Text of Scripture, that in termes aſſerts this concluſion: If he can prove it only by conſequence, let him not deny the ſame juſt and equitable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to us, of proving ſuſpenſion from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo by conſequence. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Take away the homonymie and equivocation of the terme <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,</hi> under which Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> beguiles his Reader; and it will eaſily appear, that I have not plaied with my own ſhadow, what ever he, through prejudice, may imagine. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> takes excommunication for a juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call excluſion of a Perſon from all publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances at leaſt. I know no ſuch excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Scripture, unleſſe it be evident, a perſon hath committed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: and this alſo is demonſtrable only by our conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, becauſe we are ſure no Ordinance can do ſuch a one good, no more then the Devill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. I take excommunication in the Latitude, as it notes a turning out of Communion, whether in order to any Church priviledge, or in order to diſ-Membering, which is properly a caſting out of the Church, in the rigour of the phraſe. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, I prove there were ſeverall degrees of excommunication in practice, both in the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church, <hi>page</hi> 21, 22. built upon Scripture grounds: as, when we are forbid to eat with a ſcandalous Brother, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. and 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 14. commanded to avoid them, not to keep company with them;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:120105:36"/>
the very end whereof (that they may be aſhamed) ſeemes in a ſpeciall manner to reſpect ſeparation from ſuch at the Sacrament, ſince by ſuſpenſion they are put to publick ſhame, a far more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall remedy to reduce them, then private ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alone; which yet muſt concur and back this publick ſhame, for the better obtaining of the forementioned end and purpoſe. Hence I concluded, that ſuſpenſion is excommunication, and the firſt degree thereof. And as degrees of heat do not alter the nature and kinde of heat, but that the leaſt degree of heat is as truly heat as the higheſt degree thereof; ſo the leaſt degree of excommunication is excommunication (that is, a turning out of communion, though but in part) as well as the higheſt degree. And therefore Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> granting, that excommunicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may, and ought, to be kept from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, doth therein grant, that ſuſpended perſons may be kept from the Sacrament ſince ſuſpenſion is excommunication, though in a low degree.</p>
               <p>For my exception about the word (Type) he deales very ingenuouſly, and acknowledges, <hi>That if ſtrictly taken, it is not amiſſe. Only thence he infers againſt me, that excluſion of the Legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unclean from the Congregation, is not proof for me to plead, that the Morally-unclean ought to be kept from the Sacrament; but a Type indeed, that ſuch, in whom the Leproſy, &amp;c. of ſinn raignes, ſhall be excluded Heaven.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I do not bring it as proofe yea, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that if ſequeſtring any out of the Camp, did typifie an Evangelicall Cenſure, it ſhould rather typifie turning out of Church memberſhip (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if their uncleaneſſe were incurable) than

Suſpenſion: but for my part, I believe its a type of neither.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I pray mark it, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> grants <hi>Niddui</hi> was an Excomunication.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. <hi>Pag.</hi> 46. he grants that Excommunication was a Bar to the Paſsover. Why then doth hee find fault with me for ſaying no more, then what himſelf ſaies and grants, namely, that <hi>Nid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dui</hi> in particular was a Bar to the Paſsover?</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>I but</hi> Niddui <hi>was an Excommunication</hi> only <hi>for thirty daies; and if it were a Bar to the Paſsover, a man could never be Excommunicated but at</hi> Eaſter.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> cannot be ignorant, that the time of this Excommunication, might bee doubled or trebled, yea, extended to the end of a mans life, if he continued impenitent; See <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi> Jewiſh Antiquities, <hi>pag.</hi> 200.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Its very abſurd he ſaies, <hi>that then a man could not be Excommunicated but at</hi> Eaſter. True, his Excommunication could not keep him from the Paſsover, if he were abſolved from it before the Paſsover came; no more can Suſpenſion be a Bar to the Sacrament, if a man be abſolved from it, before the Sacrament come: but the ſentence of <hi>Niddui</hi> might be iſſued out againſt a perſon at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time of the year.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Its likewiſe a groſſe miſtake (ſuppoſing this Excommunication laſted but thirty daies)
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:120105:38"/>
to hold that it is twelve to one throughout the year, whether ever it happened to concern the Paſsover. Hath Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> forgot there were two Paſsovers every year, and that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Paſsover was in the Second Month, for thoſe who could not receive in the Firſt Month? <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. &amp; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3, 15. therefore upon his own ſuppoſition it was but ſix to one in the year, that this Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation might concern the Paſsover. But what wil Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſay, if <hi>Niddui</hi> extended to an whole year, yea, to a mans whole life; did it not then clearly Barre ſuch a perſon from the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over?</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. <hi>Niddui</hi> was a Separation from eating and drinking with any, and how then could ſuch a one receive the Paſsover which was never to bee eaten alone? Its apparent then that Suſpenſion is no Novell invention: That their <hi>Niddui</hi> &amp; our <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> were very like one to the other, ſince under both, men were kept from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not from other Ordinances, but might be preſent at Divine Service, either to hear, or to teach, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> Only our Suſpenſion is far milder: ſince the males of perſons under the ſentence of <hi>Niddui,</hi> might not be circumciſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides, with us many perſons ſuſpend themſelves, and chooſe not to receive at all, rather then they will give an account of their faith to thoſe muſt give an account to God for their ſouls. Had Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> improved his Art and skill in perſwading the people to return to their duty, inſtead of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Church-Officers from painfulneſſe, watchfulneſſe, and faithfulneſſe in their duty, hee had contributed far more (than now he doth)
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:120105:38"/>
to the glory of God, the Reformation and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church, and the peace of his owne Conſcience. But I forbear.

                  <hi>My ſecond proofe was from</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 17. <hi>Theſe Corinthians were ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous many of them; and yet, ſaies the Apoſtle, We being many, are all partakers of one bread.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>He extenuates their crime, and counts it no bar to their receiving.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I may more ſafely extenuate their crime, then he may aggravate it. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Himſelfe doth not charge them with Idolatry, but ſaies only, that they were ready to go to Idols. 3<hi>ly.</hi> Yet that they were ready to commit Idolatry, is not evident by Scripture; only they gave great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſcandal and ſuſpition in that kinde, by eating things ſacrificed to Idolls, and that in the Idols Temple; which the ſtrong judged a part of their Chriſtian liberty, and thereby offended the weak: Whereupon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>latter end,</hi> the Apoſtle diſputes againſt this carnall liberty of theirs, and by commanding them to flee from Idolatry. <hi>verſe</hi> 14. he wills them to avoid the ſignes, appearances, and occaſions thereof. This carriage of theirs, I grant, was bad, but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (eſpecially before ſufficient admonition given) to bar them from the Lords Supper. Let the Reader now judge, whether in this extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation (if Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> pleaſe to call it ſo) I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:120105:39"/>
have ſinned, either againſt the light of Truth, or the law of Love.</p>
               <p n="2">Mr. Humphrey. <hi>Secondly, He confutes this himſelfe, and proves, they were guilty of groſſe ſins, by</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 21. <hi>and ſo will not allow them to be admitted. Anſ.</hi> 1. Having denyed they were guilty of Idolatry (which Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe dares not charge them withall) did I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confute my ſelfe, by granting they were guilty of other groſſe ſins? Let us ſet the two Propoſitions together. 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> The Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were not guilty of Idolatry. 2. <hi>Prop.</hi> The Corinthians were guilty of other groſſe ſins. Is here any contradiction? or, doth the latter Propoſition confute the former? 2<hi>ly.</hi> All that I ſay, <hi>page</hi> 25. and 26. is in ſubſtance this, <hi>Yet, taking it for granted, many of them were guilty of greater ſins, as appears by</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>and</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 21. <hi>how proves he from the place, that all theſe were notwithſtanding admitted, &amp;c?</hi> Let us here again ſet both Propoſitions together. 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> Perſons abuſing their Chriſtian liberty, are not preſently to be ſuſpended the Sacrament, eſpecially before ſufficient admonition given, 2. <hi>Prop.</hi> Perſons guilty of groſſe ſins, are to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the Sacrament. Are theſe two Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contradictory? or, doth the latter confute the former?</p>
               <p n="3">Mr. Humphrey. <hi>Thirdly, He ſuppoſes this too, and queſtions only</hi> Paul's <hi>allowance of it. Thus you ſee how playfull the man is; and that at one breath he can blow his bubble out, and in, and out again. Anſ.</hi> Sure Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> was merrily diſpoſed when he wrote theſe things, and hoped, the Reader would never put himſelfe to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:120105:40"/>
of comparing what I wrote with his Anſwer, but take all he ſaies upon truſt. Its well, ſince he was reſolved to bee ſo merry here, and in other parts of his <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> that he hath pitcht upon ſo inconſiderable a perſon as my ſelf for the object of his mirth. The Lord hath been pleaſed of late years to give me the cup of contempt and ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by the hands of pretious friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, whom I honour in the Lord; I may well therefore take this cup out of the hands of a ſtranger. Let him alone, the Lord hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, who ſhall ſay unto him, wherefore haſt thou done ſo? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10.</p>
               <p>But to come to the matter: my ſcope in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned words (which hee wreſts ſo pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) was to give Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> all the fair play he could deſire in order to his more effectual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. Therefore I grant him, 1. That the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians went too far towards Idolatry. 2ly. That beſides this they were guilty of other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſins. I deny, 1 That his Quotation proves thoſe groſſe ſinners were admitted to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2ly Suppoſing they were admitted <hi>de facto,</hi> I deny that his Quotation proves the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle allowed, much leſſe commanded ſuch a Free-Admiſſion. I hope Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> will give me leave to tell him theſe are ſerious matters, and will not be put off with a Jeſt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>For the firſt it is manifeſt, that theſe Corinths were Fornicators,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the Text is full to the point. St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaies, they were all partakers of this Bread. Mr.</hi> Dr. <hi>ſaies, but how will he prove, notwithſtanding they were admitted? and that they had only a right to it</hi> in actu primo. <hi>Whom ſhall we believe Mr.</hi> Paul <hi>or St.</hi> Drake.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:120105:40"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That many of the Corinths were very ſcandalons, is agreed on both ſides.</p>
               <p>But 2ly. I ſay, That, theſe ſcandalous perſons were admited to the Lords Supper, is not proved convincingly, by that Quotation: And my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe both in Scripture and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> univerſall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are not underſtood <hi>de ſingulis unius ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris,</hi> or the word <hi>All</hi> doth not alwaies include every particular perſon, or thing which in form of ſpeech ſeems to be comprehended under it. For inſtance, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 1. David <hi>ſent</hi> Joab <hi>and All</hi> Iſrael, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will any thence conclude that not one man was left in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but that every male paſſed over <hi>Jordan</hi> to deſtroy the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites? Matth.</hi> 23. 3, <hi>All therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and doe:</hi> muſt <hi>All</hi> there be underſtood without any reſtriction? then Chriſts Diſciples muſt obſerve the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and corruptions taught by the Phariſees, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Saviours expreſſe commands other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. But to come nearer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. <hi>We know that wee all have Knowledge:</hi> Yet 1 Cor. 15. 34. <hi>Some of you have not the Knowledge of God, I ſpeak this to your ſhame:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 36. hee calls them <hi>Fools,</hi> for their groſſe ignorance about that Fundamentall point of the Reſurrection. Yea, in that very particular about the Latitude of their Chriſtian Liberty. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8: He that ſaies, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>We all have Knowledge,</hi> yet ſaies <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>How be it there is not in every man this Knowledge;</hi> a clear evidence that <hi>All</hi> in the firſt verſe muſt not bee underſtod univerſally?

All with open face, beholding as in a Glaſſe the glory of the Lord</hi> &amp;c. Will Mr <hi>Humphrey</hi> hence conclude, that every Member of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had ſaving Knowledge and grace? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly every one, who, with open face beholding the glory of the Lord, is changed from glory to glory by the Spirit, is a godly man and this the Apoſtle affirmes <hi>of all the Corinths,</hi> as well as of himſelf: yet no man will urge that place to prove that every Member of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was truely godly. And why then ſhould Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> conclude, that all the <hi>Corinths</hi> did actually receive the Sacrament, becauſe the Apoſtle here uſeth a like phraſe, ſaying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Wee All are partakers of that one Bread.</hi> It is not my worke now to digreſſe, by giving my Reader an account why the Scripture uſing generall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, doth not include all particulars under that general Its ſufficient that it is uſuall in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under a generall to comprehend but ſome particulars for which, hundreds of inſtances might be produced: Yea, ſeldom in Scripture doth any generall include all particulars under it; and this kind of expreſſion is uſuall in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſcourſe, <hi>All the World knowes ſuch a thing,</hi> and <hi>who knowsaot this nor that?</hi> However therefore Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> is ſo merrily diſpoſed, that hee will break a jeſt upon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> rather then he will not be merry with Dr. <hi>Drake;</hi> Yet I hope it is now evident to the Reader, that Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> might well have been more ſerious in ſo ſerious a matter, and that though St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine be true, yet it is miſinterpreted and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applyed by M. <hi>Humphrey.</hi>

Its evident the Apoſtle ſpeaks of divers perſons (ſuppoſing, as Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> would have it, they who are the Idoll-Sacrifices, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo partake of the Lords Table, which is probable enough; though Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his ground to evidence it bee not convincing) in the whole Church going to one Table, ſome ſtrong Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who took liberty to eat things offered to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls, ſome weak Chriſtians who were offended with this their liberty, both Church-members, and both probably partaking of the Lords Table, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29 32. compare 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 7. 10. unleſſe Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> be of the mind that only the ſtrong did receive the Lords Supper, and not the weak Brethren.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Wee grant and agree with Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> that the Apoſtle doth plainly reaſon from their partaking of one of theſe Tables, againſt their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the other, which makes much for us, and againſt himſelf. From their partaking of the Devills Table, hee argues againſt their partaking of the Lords Table as well as from their parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Lords Table, he argues againſt their partaking of the Devills Table. What follows then (by Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his own grant) but that, as thoſe who partake of the Lords Table, ought not to partake of the Devills Table; ſo thoſe who partake of the Devills Table, ought not to partake of the Lords Table; A clear evidence for S. ſpenſion of Church-members that were Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally unclean: the Apoſtle doth not ſay, they ought to be Excommunicated (in Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his ſenſe, by ſequeſtration from all Ordinances) but they ought not to receive the Lords Supper; and what is this but that they are to be <hi>Suſpended?</hi> But

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He may as well argue, Thoſe who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged againſt open renouncing of Chriſt, buggery, witchcraft, blaſphemy, murther, the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. partook of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but it was not the regenerate only, but all their intelligent Members, were, by the Apoſtles Doctrine, ingaged againſt the former crimes (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe who were moſt guilty of them, and that upon open conviction, having no ſhew of repentance, and ſo being <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate) <hi>Ergò,</hi> all their intelligent members, yea, even thoſe who were <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate, did partake of the Sacrament, and were to partake of it, if the Apoſtles argument were ſufficient. You ſee how the man riſes in his latitude for admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Sacrament: <hi>page</hi> 21. and 22. he yields, that perſons <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate, may be kept from the Sacrament, though they be not actually excommunicated: <note place="margin">

                  </note> Here he tells us, that even perſons <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate ought to receive, and therefore muſt not be kept back, or elſe the Apoſtles argument is not ſufficient.

Here he brings in <hi>Calvin,</hi> as agreeing with him in his explication, that all the Iſraelites were Baptized, did eat of the Manna, and drink of the Rock, and had free Admiſſion to thoſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. All which we eaſily grant, as being clear in the Text. Againſt this, he ſaies, I bring two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions. 1.

               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>I pray ſee the words: does Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeak</hi> gratis: <hi>They did all eat the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meat? &amp;c. Nay, he ſaies not only the ſame ſpirituall meat, but the ſame ſpirituall Symbols, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>the ſame,</hi> referre clearly (as the ſcope of the context evidenceth) not to the unity of their and our Sacraments, in order to the Symbols or Elements of each, which are as manifeſtly diſtinct, as wheaten-Bread and Manna, Wine and Water: But, to their unity in receiving, or their mixed communion in thoſe Elements pel-mel, without diſtinction of good and bad, diſtracted or ſober, infant or elder per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, circumciſed or uncircumciſed, Iſraelite or Heathen, in the mixed multitude, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 38. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 4.</p>

Well may Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> perſwade men, that all Church-members, before Excommunication, may, and ought, to be admitted to the Lords Supper, if upon his dictate, they can preſently believe, that the Manna was bread made of Wheat, and the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:120105:43"/>
Rock-Water was Wine. Chriſt can turn Water into Wine, but then it muſt ceaſe to be water; but Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> can make the Element of Water to be both Wine and Water at the ſame inſtant. Nor will that ſhift help him, becauſe we ſometimes have Sack, ſometimes Claret: ſince Sack and Claret are evidently under one kinde, namely, under the kinde of Wine; but ſo is not Water. And to ſtrip him of this cavill, let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> give Water in ſtead of Wine at the Sacrament, will any ſay, he gives the ſame Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Symboll, with Wine. I deny not, but <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaies, they enjoyed the ſame ſymbols. But doth not Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> know, there is <hi>Identitas generica &amp; ſpecifica,</hi> generically a man and a tree are the ſame; yet, it's abſurd to ſay, A man is a tree, or, a tree is a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically Wine and Water are the ſame Symbolls, both being under the genus of <hi>corpus inanima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> but he who therefore ſhould ſay, that Wine and Water are the ſame Symbols, would ſpeak incongruouſly, and may as well ay, that Bread and Water are the ſame Symbols, ſince they are the ſame generically, as being both of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate bodies.

That, he would prove out of this place, is, That all intelligent Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, not actually excommunicated, ought to receive the Lords Supper, becauſe all intelligent Church-members did receive thoſe Sacraments, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.

yea, very Heathen, (not to inſtance in bruit Beaſts) ought to receive the Sacrament. Therefore, ſay we, this argument cannot ſerve his turn, there being an apparent <hi>hiatus</hi> in it. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> therefore <hi>pag.</hi> 50. perverts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the ſcope of the Apoſtle, who never intended to encourage the Corinths to receive pel-mel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Iſraelites did ſo: For then, by the ſame reaſon, hee ſhould alſo have given incouragement ro admit pel-mel, all perſons of age (living in the ſame Pariſh or Neighbourhood) to Baptiſm without any Examination or Confeſſion of their Faith, they being ſo Baptiſed unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. whereas the apparent ſcope of the Apoſtle was, to warn the Corinthians, and in them all Chriſtians, not to preſume upon Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Priviledges, but to ſtudy reall Piety, elſe they ſhould periſh for all their Priviledges; Yea, their periſhing would be ſadder, becauſe of their Priviledges; as is evident by comparing 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. to 12.</p>

                  <hi>For the difference he makes between our Elements and theirs, which he ſaies is manifeſt, namely, theirs was to nouriſh their Bodies as well as their Souls,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is groſſe, and fit for none to ſay but the Papiſts, that hold, there is left only the qualities of the Bread (that cannot nouriſh) in Tranſubſtantion.</hi>

neceſſity of our Sacramentall Bread and Wine</hi> &amp;c. I appeal now to the Reader, whether this be groſſe and Popiſh; nay, whether this bee not a very truth, which Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> cannot contradict, and therefore diſcovers too great a ſpirit of Cavilling and wreſting my ſenſe and meaning.

That I took away all bodily nouriſhment from the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Elements?

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:120105:45"/>
a diſtinction without a difference, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubject; Since the ſame ſin may be a ſin acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, and yet neceſſarily a ſin alſo. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a wicked man in hearing, praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fins accidentally; yet he ſins neceſſarily, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſin ſo long as hee continues in that eſtate. It is ſo in receiving the Sacrament, and the great reaſon we bring for his <hi>non</hi> admiſſion to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is, becauſe <hi>in ſtatu quo,</hi> (underſtand it of actuall receiving) it cannot benefit, but will certainly hurt and prejudice him. Wicked men ſin neceſſarily in their Ordinary repaſt, yet muſt eat to prevent ſtarving.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Yet further as ſome other inſtituted precepts) this is diſpenſable with, in caſe of neceſſity: as was <hi>Davids</hi> eating the Shew-bread that was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall, and for the Prieſts only.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Parellels (as Similitudes) do not run on 4. feet, nor doth the preſent Parellel lie in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing a mixed communion like theirs, but in warning us, to take heed of abuſing our Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges like them; we have Priviledges like them, Sacraments like them, are apt to abuſe our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges like them, and upon this abuſe are in danger of Gods wrath as well as they. But for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all pel-mel to the Sacrament as they did to their Sacraments of Baptiſm, <hi>Manna</hi> and Water, I am confident it never ſo much as entred into the Apoſtles heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. He breaks the neck of his own Parallel, and therefore cannot blame us in making bold with it. If his Parallel run even, then, as all ſorts without any difference did eat of the <hi>Manna,</hi> &amp; drink of the Rock, ſo all ſorts without any difference ought to receive the Lords Supper, and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

Infants, diſtracted and excommunicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; yea, Heathen alſo: Which, how abſurd!

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>I have two things here for ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſtians.</hi> 1. <hi>That to eat Chriſt ſymbolically, is no ſuch dreadful thing as is made of it, (I mean above other Ordinances): for Saint</hi> Paul <hi>makes no account to ſay, they all drank Sacramentally of of him, provided alwaies you come with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Extenuation of ſin, and Alleviation of duty, is at beſt, a wrong courſe to relieve tender Conſciences. The Goſpell holds forth duty in its ſtrickneſſe, ſin in all its aggravations more then the Law; and that Miniſter who lightens ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſins againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> or againſt Chriſt, &amp; that to his own great perill. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 19. But herein the Goſpell makes amends, that it gives ſtrength, in, and through Chriſt, to perform in ſincerity the ſtricteſt duties, and aboundant conſolation in Chriſt againſt the guilt, filth, and power of the greateſt ſins repented of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, that to eat Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, is of very great conſequence, if the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being guilty of Chriſts Body and Blood, or of eating and drinking Damnation to our ſelves,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:120105:46"/>
be of conſequence. <hi>Mr. Hnmphrey</hi> tells us, to eat Chriſt Sacramentally is no ſuch dreadfull thing. Whom ſhall we believe, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Humphrey?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> Eating Sacramentally muſt needs be more dangerous, if to abuſe Chriſt at four Ordinances be more dangerous, then to abuſe him at one or two Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>ly.</hi> Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſaies, there is no great danger, ſo you come with reverence (which yet a wicked man may do in his ſenſe.) St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, there is great danger in receiving unworthily; and the Scripture ſaies in effect, they come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, who come without the Wedding-Garment; as that evill gueſt did, elſe he had not ben ſo reproved and puniſhed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. <hi>verſe</hi> 11. to 13. yet, he is not cenſured for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. Let tender conſciences take heed, leſt by making light of ſin and duty, they bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, firſt, to ſearedneſſe, and at laſt, to deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is no danger in aggravating ſin and heightning duty, provided thereby you be driven and led to Chriſt: but very much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in lightning of either.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. By way of conceſſion: The want of grace, is no <hi>juſt</hi> hindrance to duty; yet too often it is an hindrance. And 1. naturally, to ſome du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are more ſpirituall and abſtracted, ſince I cannot do the chiefeſt part of my duty without it. Thus he who wants a principle of Gods fear, cannot do his duty in fearing God actually.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:120105:47"/>
Here the want of grace is an impediment, though no <hi>juſt</hi> impediment as to the excuſing of him who omits the duty of fearing God.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. The want of grace is an impediment Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, when at preſent a perſon is uncapable of that, for which the Ordinance was inſtituted, namely, ſpirituall Edification, which is the caſe of naturall men coming to the Sacrament. And therefore, whether the want of grace may bee an excuſe or no its enough for our purpoſe, that its a <hi>Bar</hi> to ſome duty or Ordinance. And if a naturall man will receive, hee comes at his own perill of murthering Chriſt, and of eating and drinking Damnation to himſelf: For which indeed ſelf-judging, rightly taken, is the remedy, but every naturall man falls infinitely ſhort of it, as being a ſelf juſtifier, not a ſelf-judger, till God by a Spirit of conviction force him to Legall ſelfe-judging; and by a ſpirit of grace lead and enable him to Evangellical ſelf-judging.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. The want of grace is no juſt excuſe from profeſſion in Generall; yet may well be a Bar to ſome particular Act, wherein profeſſion is held out elſe it were unlawfull to ſuſpend perſons <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate, which yet Mr. <hi>Humph</hi> allows.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>My fourth proof was from the Parable of the Feaſt,</hi> Matth. 22, Luke 14. <hi>Mr.</hi> Drake <hi>here is in a ſtreight: If he allow it applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Supper, it is clear againſt him. The Servants bring in all, both good and bad. If he wil not allow it, he goes againſt the ſtream of Divines, and wreſts out of their hands, their main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the excluſion of him that had not the Wedding Garment. The truth is, the Feaſt doth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:120105:47"/>
not ſignifie particularly the Supper, but it is as true it does it in general, as other Ordinances. The Feaſt is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> remember, that he who here charges me <hi>conditionally,</hi> with going againſt the ſtream of Interpreters, goes himſelf <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely</hi> againſt the ſtream of Divines in his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, about the Doctrine of the Sacrament. See his Rejoynder, <hi>pag.</hi> 32. to 38.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Dr. <hi>Drake</hi> his ſtreight, is only in Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> his pen or phancy; he eaſily grants the Feaſt is ſerved at the Sacrament as well as at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinances, which is evident by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Chriſt to the Feaſt, the Ordinances to the Diſhes, in which the Feaſt is ſerved. But the great Queſtion is, whether the Feaſt muſt needs bee ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to every Gueſt in every diſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Taking the Parable as particularly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the Sacrament; its ſaid indeed, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants brought in good and bad; but did the King or Maſter of the Feaſt allow choſe bad Gueſts? did he not in (the Parable of the Gueſt comming without the Garment) command thoſe very Servants to bind and caſt out evill Gueſts? I wiſh there were not too many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who bring in Gueſts of all ſorts: but let ſuch remember, its their Lord's will ſuch ſhould be turned away: they who, have not the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment, and care not for the Feaſt it ſelf, are unworthy of the Diſh.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. That it cannot bee meant particularly or ſtrictly of the Sacrament or any other Ordinance, eſpecially in reference to <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> is evident, becauſe thoſe who abſented themſelves upon their neceſſary worldly occaſions, are judged as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:120105:48"/>
unworthy: but certainly, he that abſents himſelfe from a Sermon or Sacrament upon a neceſſary worldly occaſion, is not preſently unworthy of the Marriage Feaſt, but he that withdraws from Chriſt, who is the Feaſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly. Its remarkable, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> grants, that the ſtream of Divines improve the inſtance of the Gueſt, who wanted a Wedding Garment, againſt his free admiſſion. All hee hath to ſay againſt them herein, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 53.</note> is, <hi>That this excluſion, being the Act of the Lord, their Inference from it, is not well applyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> plead the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Servants for admittance, while we have he command of the Lord for Excluſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Are not thoſe very Servants who brought him in, commanded to ſhut him out?</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Is not this done at the very ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which he was invited, if Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> wil needs have it to be the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Humphrey. It is true, if men be ſcandalous, they are lyable to cenſure; but who does not ſee this upon another account, I mean of Diſcipline, to ſatisſie the Church, amend them, and warn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But if you do it upon this ground of ſetting up a aiſcriminating Ordinance, I think it not according to the mind of the Lord of the Feaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> practiſe Suſpenſion upon the account of Diſcipline, which is a very good and warrantable account: We ſhall not ſtrain his or any mans Conſcience elſe, to riſe up to our account of a diſcriminating Ordinance. Men may agree in the ſame practice, upon ſeverall principles. We have ſeverall Judgements as well
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:120105:48"/>
as ſeveral palates: One may eat Sugar becauſe its ſweet, an other becauſe its abſterſive, a third be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its healing and conſolidating. Let us agree upon Unity of practice, and I hope we ſhall not fall out upon diverſity of principle. Excellent is the counſell of the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. Let Chriſtians endeavour agreement in practice as far as they can, and wait upon Heaven, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light, to reconcile them in Unity of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> miſtakes me. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Page</hi> 54.</note> I hope he takes me not for a Ranter, or One above, or againſt all Ordinances. Though I diſtinguiſh between the Feaſt and the Diſhes, in which it is ſerved; yet I do not ſeparate the Feaſt from all the Diſhes. Doth it follow, a man muſt eat the Feaſt without a Diſh, becauſe he muſt not eat it in every Diſh? we grant all may eat the Feaſt in the Diſh of the Word. <hi>Contra,</hi> Himſelf would have ſome eat the Feaſt without any Diſh, to wit, perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. His fine ſtory therefore is more applicable to himſelf then to us, who grudge the egge of the Goſpell to none, though we do not think, it is to be eaten in every ſhell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>He urges, then ſhould Heathen be admitted.</hi> Anſ. <hi>And ſo they may, if they come in an orderly way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Content, And ſo may every Church-member if he come in an orderly way: but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittting of groſly ignorant, and ſcandalous Church-members is no orderly way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>Thirdly, Hee addes, How were the unthank full Gueſts alſo excluded? And anſwers himſelfe, Becauſe they would not come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:120105:49"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its apparent, they were ſhut out by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the King, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 24. and that others were compelled in to fill the houſe, that there might bee no room for the unthankful Gueſts. Whence its probable, the Parable more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and immediately concerned the rejection of the Jewes, that the Gentiles might be received in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. 25. 28. 30.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. If it be particularly applicable to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what follows, but that they who ſleight the Sacrament, deſerve to be ſuſpended from it. But doth Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> think there is no ſleighting of the Sacrament but by keeping from it? Did not he that came without the Wedding Garment ſleight the Sacrament, as well as they who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely kept from it?</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. As ſleighters of Chriſt crucified, repenting, may yet partake of him; ſo ſleighters of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the Picture of Chriſt crucified, may yet partake of it, upon their repentance. Only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. That, as ſleighting is viſible or inviſible, ſo repentance muſt be viſible or inviſible: And if vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſleighters repent viſibly, we hope, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> nor any elſe ſhall have cauſe to cenſure us for keeping them away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>Fourthly, he tells us, Worldly buſineſſe may detain a man from the Sacrament.</hi> Anſ. <hi>Who doubts it? but there is no ſtrength in this reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Worldly buſineſſe detaines a man either from the time and place of receiving; or takes a man ſo up, as hee wants time to prepare himſelf for the Sacrament. Upon either of theſe accounts abſtinence is juſtifiable, if the buſineſſe be indiſpenſible. In the latter branch, worldly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:120105:49"/>
buſineſſe keeps a man from the Sacrament, becauſe it hinders him in order to actuall preparation. And if perſons who want actuall preparation, muſt for preſent abſtain, doth it not follow <hi>à for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori,</hi> That perſons who want both actuall and habituall preparation ought much more to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain? But ſuch are all groſsly Ignorant perſons, and moſt of ſcandalous perſons. Let the Reader judge then whether there be not much ſtrength in my reaſon, what ever Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> may phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the contrary: for hee brings not one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt my reaſon, only with a ridiculous ſtory indeavours to catch his Reader.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 55.</note> 
                  <hi>In the way. For my quoting that text,</hi> Luke 12. 42. <hi>&amp;c. Mr.</hi> Drake <hi>need not have given me ſuch ill words,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I meddle not with his perſon; Only, <hi>I ſay that his Interpretation</hi> (or rather applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) of that Text, to encourage Miniſters to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all Intelligent Church-members pel-mel, <hi>is groſſe, ſenceleſſe and prophane;</hi> and if my reaſon urged, <hi>pag.</hi> 32. be not convincing to prove it ſo, then let me ſuffer as a raſh Cenſurer. If judging an errour, be it where it will, to be as bad as indeed it is, be a giving of ill words to that perſon who holds it, then who can uncaſe an errour without breach of charity? I ſhall thank Mr <hi>Humphrey</hi> for laying open my errours in their native dreſſe. Errour (as well as Vice) deforms, though it doth not unſtate a godly man; it doth not, I am ſure it ſhould not, gain Luſtre by his piety. An errour that is groſſe, ſenſeleſſe, and prophane, may bee taken notice of, and branded though it flye to a godly man for Sanctuary. I think its no breach of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:120105:50"/>
Charity ſeverely to cenſure an erour in a godly perſon, ſo it be without bitter reflection upon his perſon yet a paſſionate reflection is not ſo cutting as an Ironicall reflexion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>My Fifth proof was from</hi> Johns <hi>Free-Baptiſm even of thoſe, he calls Vipers: And yet Mr.</hi> Drake <hi>as he is wont, anſwers me thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly.</hi> He ſaies but proves not that <hi>John</hi> Baptiſed all Commers. <hi>He ſhould ſay, he does not prove it, only brings Scripture for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That <hi>All</hi> is not in many places to be underſtood Univerſally, I have formerly clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. That it is not here to be taken Univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is as evident; for then <hi>John</hi> muſt have Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed every man and woman in <hi>Judea,</hi> and round about <hi>Jordan;</hi> which how unlikely, let Maſter <hi>Humphrey</hi> himſelf judge.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. That it cannot be meant of all Commers, neither is demonſtrable from the Text, unleſs Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> can make it out, that all Commers did profeſſe their repentance, and confeſſe their ſins, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 6 and particularly the Phariſees whom he calls a Generation of Vipers, and falls very foul upon them comming to his Baptiſme, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. In ſaying therefore, Mr. <hi>Humphrey proves not.</hi> I mean, he brings not Scripture; for Scripture miſinterpreted and wreſted is not Scripture. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> I ſee is upon a merry pin, but ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would more become him. Let the Reader peruſe my anſwer, <hi>page</hi> 32, &amp; 33. and he will eaſily perceive, there is no ſuch ground of inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his part.</p>
               <p>For his Rule, <hi>Adultis eadem eſt ratio utriuſque
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:120105:50"/>
Sacramenti.</hi> I muſt tel I him again, It makes much for us, and againſt himſelf. Since by this Rule at every Sacrament, men ought to give an account of their faith, as they do at Baptiſme. The force of this anſwer to avoid, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 56.</note> Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> ſhuffles <hi>pag.</hi> 56, and tell us, there is <hi>eadem ratio,</hi> but not <hi>in omnibus, and that the very comming of Church-members is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Is it fair Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſhould bring a Rule to bind us, and yet will not be bound by it himſelf?</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Whether it hold <hi>in omnibus</hi> or no, it muſt hold in the matter controverted. Now the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in controverſie between me and Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> is, whether every Receiver before receiving ought to make profeſſion of his faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. This Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> denies, and for an argument makes uſe of this Rule, <hi>Adulits eadem eſt ratio,</hi> &amp;c. We ſay, Content, but <hi>Adulti</hi> are bound to profeſſe their faith and repentance before Baptiſme, therefore they are bound to profeſſe the ſame before Receiving, for (according to Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Rule) there is the ſame reaſon of both Sacraments. And as the offering of ownes ſelf to Baptiſm, is not ſufficient profeſſion in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Baptiſm; ſo the offering of ones ſelf to the Lords Supper, is not profeſſion ſufficient in order to the receiving of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>M. Humphrey. <hi>My proof is</hi> Acts 2. 41, 42, 46. <hi>which Text he leaves out; you may conceive, it hath ſilenced him: For while we find thouſands admitted thus freely and equally (not omitting his phraſe of pel-mel) in their breaking bread (I
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:120105:51"/>
ſay even wholly alike) as in doctrine and prayer, we dare not fall down to that Sacramentall Rule upon tryall he would ſet up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. What ever Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> may think of me, I hope one convincing Scripture for his feee Admiſſion, ſhould have ſilenced me every where and not onely here. I deſire to bee in their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Not conviction of the ſtrength, but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the weakneſſe of his proof as to the point intended, together with ſtudy of brevity, made me paſſe it over in ſilence. But ſince he will needs have me lay open his nakedneſſe, as well here as elſe where, I ſhall not think much of my paines for his further conviction, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Their Admiſſion, therefore, pel-mel makes nothing for Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Admiſſion pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel ſince thoſe three thouſand had but juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made profeſſion of their faith and repentance; 2ly. Held forth that profeſſion exemplarily both in works of Piety and Charity. 3ly. But two of them <hi>(Ananias &amp; Saphira)</hi> contradicting their profeſſion by Hypocriſy, were put to an other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates Teſt then our Church-members are. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> Divers of our Church-members are groſſely ignorant, or openly proſane, covetous, griping, oppreſſive, or erroneous and hereticall in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentalls.

judgement, that he who is abſolutely unclean, is not ſtraightwaies relatively unclean: and that wicked mens preſence and receiving doth not defile the godly who receive with them; but the godly contract guilt and pollution by virtuall conſent to their wickedneſſe, as if they do not reprove them, or inform againſt them being obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.

               <p n="2">2ly. Therefore there is a twofold renouncing of Chriſt, 1. Virtuall by wittingly acting or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in any known ſin, eſpecially groſſe and ſcandalous. 2ly. Formall and expreſſe by word and deed, as Witches, Jews, and Turks do. Both theſe a man may do &amp; yet be a Church-member, (in Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his ſence) till Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated. The latter makes him faederally unclean, not ſo the former at leaſt preſently. Therefore the Children of the former are more capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm then the Children of the latter; yea, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the former were Excommunicated, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not: much more, if the former be not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. A formall and expreſſe rejection of Chriſt and the Covenant, contributes far more to Separation from Chriſt, then a virtuall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretative rejecting of either. By all hath been ſaid, it appears that by the two forementioned places compared (which Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> would faine ſet together by the Ears) I anſwer, not my ſelf but Mr. <hi>Humphrey.</hi> My other three excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe he only Quibbles upon them, but anſwers them not, I paſſe; as alſo his vapour in the cloſe, ſince my work is not to anſwer words but Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:120105:53"/>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>For the cloſe hereof, I gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up ſome Texts, as,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>&amp;c. that doth ſet forth the moſt free offers of Jeſus Chriſt, which, though Mr.</hi> Drake <hi>make but light of, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I make not light of the offers of free grace, but ſay, thoſe free offers are no ground for his Free Admiſſion to the Sacrament, ſince thoſe offers are free to Heathen and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate perſons (as well as to Church-Members) who undoubtedly are not to be admitted to the Lords Supper. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Add Church-memberſhip to theſe free offers, ſince perſons, <hi>jure</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, are Church-members, and are alſo under theſe free offers; yet, may be kept away, as Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> grants, <hi>page</hi> 21. Is it not evident, that free grace may be conditionally offered and applyed to Church members, though they do not receive the Sacrament, but are juſtly barr'd from it for the preſent. 3<hi>ly.</hi> Whereas he addes, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is proportionably gratious in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rernall, as he is in his internall priviledges, &amp;c.</hi> What followes from thence, but that as they who reject internall priviledges, ſhall miſſe of, and be kept from, them; ſo they who reject externall priviledges (further then thoſe priviledges are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in order to their converſion) ought to be kept from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> True if they reject them: But we keep many away who deſire the Sacrament. <hi>Anſ.</hi> So Chriſt keeps internall priviledges from many, who, in ſome ſenſe, deſire them, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. May not an Hypocrite deſire truth of grace, as a neceſſary means to free him from Hell &amp;c. who yet at the ſame time, rejects and hates holineſſe?
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:120105:54"/>
Now the ſigne and thing ſignified are Correlates, and he that rejects either, rejects both interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively. He then that rejects Grace, rejects the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the ſigne of Grace; and therefore upon Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his own Principle, ought to be kept from it, unleſſe actuall receiving be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance, &amp;c. of which afterwards.

                  <hi>What ſenſe is there in this? Jeſus Chriſt is to be freely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth, to bring men home effectually to him; and yet muſt the Receiver make out that right unto the Miniſter, before we dare offer, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally apply him to them,</hi> reaches not our caſe home: We granting that Chriſt ought to be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered, and conditionally applyed to all, be they Church-members or not: But, is there no way of offering, or conditionally applying, Chriſt, to all, or to any, but by his actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament?</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>We muſt not make the notion of ſealing ſo dreadfull, and bring ſo much blood upon our ſoules; we need not fear to judge the Heathen, viſible Rebels, &amp;c.</hi>

The truth is, if many of our people minded Heaven but halfe ſo much as they minde Earth, they would upon their very knees intreat us, to do that againſt every Sacrament, which we beg of them we may do but once, in order to their edification, comfort, and ſalvation: Yet, they will not hearken unto us, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, in ſome poor meaſure (though we dare not ſay, we have endeavoured our uttermoſt, <hi>de jure,</hi> in any thing) we may waſh our hands from the guilt of the blood of their poor ſoules.

               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>I ſhall begin with the laſt. His
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:120105:57"/>
words are theſe.</hi> The word and the Sacrament, tis true, muſt go hand in hand together: but the Covenant of grace, or the Word is not (viſibly) applicable to all, therefore not the Sacrament. Mr. <hi>H. For my anſwer to this, which is all his weight with but a very few grains more: We muſt know, The Miniſters of Chriſt are the Miniſters of the New-Covenant to be revealed, &amp; that not of the abſolute,</hi> Heb. 8. <hi>which is ſecret, and belonging to Election;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>but of the conditionall Covenant, (or the Covenant in its conditionall capacity) which is tenderable to all the World and that more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially applicable with a diſtinction of outward priviledges, and intereſt to the Church. Now look what is the Tenor of the Covenant, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſeales; and nothing elſe. May not I ſay to all, and every Intelligent Church-member, If thou believe thou ſhalt be ſaved? and may not I ſeal to ſuch what the Word ſaies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Granting we are Miniſters of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall Covenant, how doth that exclude us from being Miniſters of the abſolute Covenant? Is not the abſolute Covenant revealed in the Word, as well as the Conditionall Covenant; and ought not Miniſters to declare unto people the whole Counſell of God. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 29. Is not the writing of the Law in the heart, part of the abſolute Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10? and is not the whole Covenant of Grace ſealed at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Are not Miniſters Inſtruments of Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Edification, and thereby of applying the abſolute Covenant. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6? Is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (in Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his profeſt judgement) a means of Converſion, and yet hath it nothing to do with the abſolute Covenant?</p>

2ly. If the Conditionall Covenant be tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to all the World (as Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerts) will it not follow (he building his Free-admiſſion upon this Principle) that all the World ought to be admitted to the Sacrament. To uſe his own words, <hi>May not I ſay to all</hi> (not onely to every intelligent Church-member) <hi>If thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved? and may not I ſeal to ſuch what the Word ſaies?</hi> Chriſt is tenderable to all, conditionally, be they Church-members or no, and that in every Ordinance, therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Heathen may be preſent at prayer, hearing, Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and why not proportionably at the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> in all which the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall tender of Chriſt is univerſally held forth. But doth it thence follow that Chriſt is, or muſt be applyed to all by way of promiſe or Seal in either of theſe? The Latitude then of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-tender, is no ground for the Latitude of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Free-Admiſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. Nor will the Latitude of the Covenant Tender, prove it ſhould be apply'd by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all Intelligent Church-members: for then it ought to be applyed to perſons <hi>jure</hi> Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, who yet (according to truth, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his own grant) may be ſuſpended. Might not <hi>Theodoſius</hi> have pleaded the Latitude of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, when <hi>Ambroſe</hi> denyed him the Sacrament divers months together for his cruelty in Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring thouſands of Theſſalonians upon the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater? Yea, might he not have pleaded, that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his great guilt he had more need to receive the Sacrament, that thereby he might ſeal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to himſelf for his deeper conviction and humiliation? yea, if Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Doctrine
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:120105:58"/>

If upon tryall we have ground to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them, then we can ſpeak thoſe words to them only conditionally: But, when we have evidence they are in the ſtate of Nature, and know they have not the Condition, it's in vain to ſay to them in that eſtate, Chriſt is thine, if thou do believe; And it's all one, as if I ſhould ſay to a proud and inſolent Traytor, acting in the height of Rebellion, Sir, Pardon is yours, if you do come in and ſubmit; taking the words in their Grammaticall conſtruction, I may aſſure him he ſhall be pardoned, if he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently come in, and ſubmit: But, it's incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſay, Sir, Pardon is yours, if you do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ſince at preſent he is viſibly neither an object

his Conſcience, and preſume upon God though he loſt his place and life too. So that he muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity come over to us, and then he may know how neither to commit an untruth nor a lie neither, by ſaying, He offers or applies Chriſt but conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The truth is, ſeeing the Miniſter is Gods Embaſſador, and what he does is by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, we may as ſoon ſay, the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>can lie, as that the Miniſter ever Seales an untruth, or lie either, in doing his Office,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Therefore, in propounding the Objection, he takes not my words; but frames it for his own advantage and my prejudice.

Beſides that in the latter branch alſo, I uſe not the terme of Sealing, but of giving the Sacrament. And however he may poſſibly agree with me in ſenſe, yet the termes altered may occaſion a foule miſtake in the Reader. But to paſſe that: Let us ſcan his exceptions againſt my anſwer to that Objection.</p>

And 1. He corrupts my Text in the anſwer, as he did in the objection. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> frames my anſwer thus, <hi>He does but Seal to an untruth, not to a lie, ſo long as he comes in to the Elders, and is thought viſibly worthy by them.</hi> page 63. This Anſwer thus framed is obſcure, abſurd, and little better than nonſence. Obſcure, the ſecond Perſon <hi>thee,</hi> being there applicable, either to the Miniſter admitting, or to the perſon admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Abſurd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as making the Reader believe we hold, That the Miniſter, without danger of a lie, may aſſure that Communicant of a ſaving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, who he is aſſured hath no part in Chriſt, and all becauſe the Elders have approved that Communicant againſt the vote and certaine Knowledge of the Miniſter. Beſides, That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>He is thought viſibly worthy,</hi> is little better then nonſence. For I pray, what is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon viſibly worthy, but one that is thought and judged worthy, at leaſt upon evidence of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledge and vacancy of ſcandall. So then to think a perſon is viſibly worthy, is to think I think ſuch a man worthy, which for my part, I think is little better then non-ſence, either in Grammer, Logick, or Rhetorick. Thus you ſee how Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> propounds my Anſwer, I will not ſay, faithfully, but I dare ſay very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently.</p>
               <p>My anſwer to the Objection is this, <hi>pag.</hi> 48. <hi>He may poſſibly Seal to an untruth, but doth not Seal to a lie, in admitting that perſon, whom in charity (being approved, upon due tryall) he may and ought to judge worthy.</hi> 2ly. <hi>If the Miniſter ſuſpect a perſon legally approved, he may and ought the more carefully to warn him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:120105:61"/>
this means I conceive he may clear himſelf, but cannot keep back him that is approved by the Major vote of the Elderſhip. Onely afterwards hath power to appeal,</hi> &amp;c. Let the Reader now judge, whether by Sealing a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt to a perſon whom I may and ought to think Evangelically worthy, the Miniſter doth Seal to a lie. Or 2ly. If he Seale a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt to a perſon whom himſelf ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects (yet cannot evince to be unworthy, and whom others having the ſame power and piety with himſelf judge worthy) be a Sealing to a lie? If indeed the Miniſter know this perſon to be unworthy, as being in the ſtate of nature or <hi>jure</hi> Excommunicate, here the caſe is much altered: of which I ſpeak not in that Paragraph, onely I am much beholding to Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to pin ſuch an abſurdity upon my ſleeve. If Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> and the Reader deſire my judgement in this particular; For my part, if not only a Presbytery, but if a Claſſis, yea, Province voted a perſon worthy whom I knew to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy (as having ſufficient evidence of his groſs, ignorant, or ſcandalous converſation backt with impenitency and obſtinacy) I muſt deſire them all to excuſe me for giving the Sacrament to ſuch a one. Yet would I not make any ſtirre in the Church, if they appointed an other Miniſter to give him the Sacrament in my Congregation: By which means, I apprehend, I ſhall be both cleare of the guilt of his Admiſſion, and withall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the peace and unity of the Church. And, ſhould this carriage of mine coſt me a Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I hope I ſhould chuſe rather to ſuffer a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:120105:62"/>
then to commit a Morall evill. The caſe may be illuſtrated by other Acts of Judicature, both Civill and Sacred. Suppoſe the Elderſhip vote the Excommunication of a perſon whom I knew to be innocent, or vote the <hi>non</hi>-Excommunication of a perſon whom I knew to be <hi>jure</hi>-Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate: In ſuch caſe they muſt give me leave to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my proteſt, and not to act according to their vote againſt my Knowledge and Conſcience. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in Civill Tryalls, ſuppoſe the Jury find a perſon guilty, whom the Judge knowes to be Innocent, were I Judge in that caſe, I hope, by Gods aſſiſtance, neither Law nor Jury ſhould prevail with me to pronounce ſentence againſt ſuch a perſon. The like might be ſaid about the Judges clearing a perſon whom hee knows to be guilty, yet is acquitted by the Jury, if the Judge ſhould be put to pronounce a Sentence of abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt his Knowledge and Conſcience: Which yet I think is not in practice amongſt us, ſince the Verdict of the Jury doth acquit the Priſoner; only the Judge in ſuch caſe might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complain of the Jury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> My drift and ſcope in all this, is to ſhew the weakneſſe of Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> his Cords, where-with he thinks to bind me, and withall that I might make it appear to the Reader, That however <hi>pag.</hi> 64. Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> triumphs before the Victory, yet <hi>we are not forced either to lie on the one hand, or to come over to Mr.</hi> Humphry <hi>on the other hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the laſt clauſe in this Paragraph, <hi>That, ſeeing a Miniſter is Gods Embaſſadour, and what he doth is by Commiſſion, we may as ſoone ſay, the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:120105:62"/>
God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>can lic, as that the Miniſter either Seals an untruth or tie, in doing his Office.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Either the ſenſe is, That a Miniſter when he acts <hi>clave non errante,</hi> Seales neither an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth nor a lie, which is as pertinent, as if I ſhould ſay, when Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> Preaches Truth, hee Preaches not an untruth or lie. Or his meaning is, that, becauſe a Miniſter is Commiſſioned by Chriſt, therefore he cannot erre in this or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of his Miniſteriall function; which as it is a palpable errour, ſo it ſmells ſtrongly of Popiſh infallibility.</p>
               <p>What he addes by way of amplification; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 64, 65, 66.</note> as there is much truth in it, ſo his great miſtake lies in apprehending, that we cannot judge a perſon to be worthy or unworthy, but preſently we med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with Gods Ark, and enter upon Gods Throne. The weakneſſe of which inference hath been formerly laid open, and therefore I do but only note it here.</p>
               <p>For his anſwer to my exception againſt divers Church-members receiving, <note place="margin">Pag. 66.</note> though all may bee preſent, <hi>&amp;c. That yet the Miniſter may be free in his Office, in delivering the Sacrament in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall as Chriſt did, and that eſpecially becauſe it is a viſible Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This indeed accompanied with due admonition, may be a relief to the Miniſter, hee being thereby excuſed from giving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perſons viſibly unworthy; <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>My mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, If the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in the vote of the Elders, and do not his indeavour in a Morall way to have ſuch a perſon kept from receiving. For I do not think the Miniſter is bound to thruſt him away from the Table, or to pull the Bread and Cup violently out of his hands, who upon the unrighteous vote and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Elders laies hold upon thoſe holy myſteries.</hi>
                  </note> but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:120105:63"/>
clear him of guilt, as permitting them to eat and drink judgment to themſelves, whom he ought to keep back.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. Though the Elements and divers Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall actions be explicatory, and ſo a viſible word common to all, be they Church-members or no, yet giving and receiving are applicatory, and where a Miniſter or a private Chriſtian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apply the writing or promiſe of Chriſt (I ſpeak as <hi>de jure</hi>) there they cannot apply the ſeal of that writing.</p>
               <p>Here I cannot but take notice of Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> his ingenuity, in confeſſing, That preſence at the Sacrament is more free than actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, in theſe words: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 68.</note> 
                  <hi>Not that I am ſo moved at free preſence, but that actuall receiving is not as free to our intelligent Members.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Not that bare preſence makes them guilty, but their unworthy carriage at the Sacrament, and their unprofitableneſſe under it as a viſible word.</hi>
                  </note> And I do as eaſily yield to him, that by preſence onely, perſons may be guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt as well as by receiving, but not as much, ſince actuall receiving is like <hi>Judas</hi> his betraying Chriſt with a kiſſe, whereby hee contracted deeper guilt then others of his damned Crew, eſpecially ſuch as came haply to ſee Chriſt taken, but put not forth a tongue or hand in order to Chriſts apprehenſion. Yet withall, it being agreed on both hands, that preſence is freer then receiving (for which Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> himſelfe holds forth the practice of the Primitive Church) let him confider how he will ſalve his own Objections againſt this Tenet; and that it argues weakneſſe for a man to yield the Cauſe, and yet to diſpute againſt it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>Indeed if perſons be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate

(as the Primitive Church did puniſh ſuch with bare preſence) or men have their gathered Companies; if they do not communicate with thoſe who are preſent, and hear, their reaſon is open, they own them not as their Members: But as for us, that are not yet convinced by them, either we muſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or new-mould, our mixed Congregations.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> cannot be ignorant, that in the Primitive times, perſons excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated in this ſenſe, were not to be preſent at the Sacrament, ſince the fourth degree of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhut perſons quite out of the Church, where they were to ſtand with tears, requeſting thoſe who entred in, to pray for them; and thence they were called <hi>Plorantes.</hi> See <hi>Goodwin's Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> They who were quite ſhut out of the Church, could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Sacrament, adminiſtred in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. 2<hi>ly.</hi> It appears further by this Anſwer of Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> that in the Primitive Times, ſuſpenſion was a part or degree of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince ſome perſons excommunicated might be preſent, yet, not receive; but others might neither be admitted to preſence, nor to receiving. And this makes much for us, and againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who grants, that perſons excommunicated, may be kept from the Sacrament: But, ſay we, perſons juridically ſuſpended, are excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (both in our ſenſe, and in the ſenſe of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church) <hi>Ergo,</hi> By Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his own Principle, they are to be kept from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. 3<hi>ly.</hi> The ground of their ſeparation from us, who are in gathered Companies (yet are not Browniſts) is it not, becauſe we admit pel-mel, Church members viſibly unworthy? And, had
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:120105:64"/>
our Sacraments been kept pure, their very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſeparation had been cut off (I mean, as to the point of Communicants). Beſides, ſome of thoſe ſeparated Congregations, have admitted to their Sacraments our Church-members, whom they apprehended godly, when at the ſame time, other Church-members of ours, concerning whom, they have not had ſufficient evidence of their piety, did not paſſe for current. A clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they (as well as we) look more at viſible worthineſſe, then at Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>

of the Sacraments, is it not eaſie to retort out of the ſame place, that then, by the ſame reaſon, they ought not to read the Scripture, or to hear the Word Preached, and the Covenant declared and publiſhed, ſince all theſe were in ſome way, peculiar to the Jewes. Yea, to ſome Sacraments, Heathen were admitted; namely, to Baptiſme under the Cloud, to the Manna, and to the Rock-Water, to wit, the mixed Multitude, as well as divers uncircumciſed Iſraelites, in which there was ſomewhat extraordinary. I agree with Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> that Heathen may partake of the Word, yet not of the Sacraments; but his proof thereof from <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and 9. is not valid.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> He miſtakes, in ſaying the Word is not a ſealed Inſtrument to Heathen; and in thinking, the Word is not ſealed to Heathen by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unleſſe they partake of the Sacraments, Shew me any Covenant in the World, where the Seales doth not concern them, whom the Articles of the Covenant doe concern. If the Articles of the Covenant of Grace concern all the World, and are publiſhed and tendered to all conditionally, what abſurdity is there, in ſealing the ſame conditionall offer to all, in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> The ſealing of the Covenant is generall or particular; on Gods part, or on mans part. In generall, God ſeales the Covenant by every Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament conditionally to all the World: Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, he ſeales the Covenant to the worthy Receiver at the Sacrament. Further, whether I Receive or no, God ſeales the Covenant to me as well as to others, in generall; but, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, I my ſelfe ſeal in particular, which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:120105:65"/>
ſtanders by do not. We eaſily agree with Mr. <hi>Humphrey, That every Church-member (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a juſt forfeiture) hath a publick right to the uſe of the Sacrament.</hi> But, the Queſtion is, Wherein this forfeiture lies? We ſay, the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lies in viſible unworthineſſe: He ſaies, it lies in Excommunication. We anſwer, That cannot be, ſince forfeiture of a priviledge is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an offence; but, excommunication rightly managed is no offence. The Church indeed by excommunication takes the forfeiture, but the Church-member by the offence makes the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture. This offence known, is nothing elſe, but his viſible unworthineſſe, upon which, the Church may juſtly deny him the uſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament for all his publick right to it as a Church-member. Herein indeed, an unworthy Church-member is diſtinguiſhed from an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, in that he hath a publick right to the Sacrament (as a Jew, when unclean, had to the Paſſover; and a Prieſt, when unclean, had to the holy Things) which no Heathen have. But the influence of that right is ſuſpended, as to his actuall receiving, till he viſibly repent, of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible unworthineſſe.</p>

I have formerly ſhewed, that they who hear and ſee unworthily at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt; as well, but not as much, as thoſe who receive: Yet, becauſe hearing and ſeeing may be

                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>To his ſecond Exception. VVe hold not, that Baptiſme is to be repeated; nor do we believe, that Chriſt hath commanded abſolutely all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Church-members to receive. But, as a Circumciſed Jew might be kept from the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when Legally or Morally unclean; ſo may a Baptized Chriſtian be kept from the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, when Morally unclean.</p>

               <p>To his third Exception we anſwere.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:120105:66"/>
Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> peruſe Mr. <hi>Timſon's</hi> Anſwer, <hi>page</hi> 3. and 4. who, though zealous for free Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, yet lookes at this Argument as very weak. 2<hi>ly.</hi> I have anſwered formerly, that in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> his Admiſſion, Chriſts diſpenſation was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and ſo not imitable by us. 3<hi>ly.</hi> We admit all to the Marriage Feaſt, as well, yea, more then himſelfe, but not to cat the Feaſt in every Diſh; yea, we admit all to the Sacrament, but not to every Sacramentall action. 4<hi>ly.</hi> If putting the ignorant upon knowledge, the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe upon diligence to prepare, the hard-hearted upon repentance, be to make them more ſecure, careleſſe, and hard-bearted, we muſt confeſſe our ſelves guilty of Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his charge; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, not. And certainly, if our ſuſpenſion from but part of one Ordinance, do harden (as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends) what will his excommunication from all Ordinances do? 5<hi>ly.</hi> For his charging us, <hi>To afflict tender Conſciences;</hi> We ſee not how any ſuch Concluſion can flow from our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, rightly underſtood; or, that our Principles tend, <hi>to lay waſt the Ordinance of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> We deſire, that every Ordinance may be uſed in every Congregation, particularly, the Lords Supper, where there are any Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members capable of it. Nor do we believe, the Adminiſtration of this Sacrament doth abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon the being or acting of the Elders, who are not neceſſary to the <hi>eſſe,</hi> but to the <hi>bone eſſe</hi> of the Church, and to the more regular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacrament. We believe, the principall care of Soules lies upon Miniſters, who therefore ought to do their duty (whether they have Elders or no) in fitting their people for,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:120105:67"/>
and then admitting them to the Sacrament. Nor do we apprehend what there can be in this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of ours, to afflict tender Conſciences, whom of all perſons we ſhall moſt willingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: If indeed we forced any to approve, and own tryall before the Elderſhip, there might be ſome plea againſt us in that kinde; but, that there ſhould be any ſuch thing in giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our faith before any, eſpecially to our Miniſter, who, without all controverſy, is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with our Soules, as he that muſt give an account to God for them, is to me a very ſtrange paradox. Yet further; Suppoſe one be kept from the Sacrament, yea, unjuſtly kept from it, what is there here to ſcruple his conſcience? It may indeed grieve his ſpirit, and cauſe him to reflect, and that to his great and ſpirituall advantage; but the ſin is theirs who do unjuſtly detain him. For our part, if we know any thing of our ſelves, our great care is to invite, and encourage tender Conſciences, to partake of, not to keep them from, the Sacrament; and ſuch we are aſſured, will never put us againſt our Conſciences, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all pel-mel. A tender Conſcience is tender of other mens Conſciences, as well as of its own.</p>

Nor will his following words be a <hi>ſalvo</hi> for this wide gap, <hi>That as we offer the conditions thereof to any, ſo likewiſe may we, and muſt we, the ſeal (upon their deſire) &amp;c. page</hi> 15. of his Vindication: Unleſſe we have good evidence (at leaſt in the judgment of charity) that their deſire is reall, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>verſe</hi> 36, 37. And hence, when Heathen came on to the Church, they were firſt <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni,</hi> and gave evidence of their faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, before they were admitted Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and Baptized: Nor was <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> till upon good evidence, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 26, 27. And why the like care ſhould not be uſed in the Sacrament of growth, as was in the Sacrament of initiation, there being with us ſo great a diſtance of time, between the one and the other, and we having ſo good ground to fear the declenſion of Church-members, as well as they had to fear the hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall approach of Church-candidates; Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey,</hi>

For our parts, we believe the Covenant is ſealed conditionally in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all the World, as well at to all Church-members: But, from thence to argue, that all the world, or every Church-member, ſhould receive the Sacrament, is a concluſion, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> himſelfe cannot ſwallow, much leſſe others, who are not of his large Principles.

What Chriſt might do as a Miniſter,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:120105:69"/>
is an other queſtion; and of that I ſpake, and ſaid, That if Chriſt, as a Miniſter, might ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend or excommunicate, then every Miniſter might by himſelfe alone ſuſpend and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate; which power, if given to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Miniſter, might provefatall to the Church: Nor do I finde in Scripture, that one particular Miniſter is the Church governing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. Yet withall, for further explication of my ſelfe in that particular, I think we may ſafely diſtinguiſh between a regular and irregular ſtate of the Church. Where Church-government can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſetled regularly, in that caſe, I believe, much lies upon the Miniſter: or, where the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders will not act, I do not apprehend, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sacraments are to be omitted; but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who on all hands is acknowledged as an undoubted Officer, muſt endeavour to ſupply that defect. Haply, in ſome caſes, and for ſome perſons, the Elders for a time may devolve the ſole power of tryall upon the Miniſter, where they have good aſſurance of his integrity. 2<hi>ly.</hi> I diſtinguiſh between the Miniſters Paſtorall and Judiciall power: Suppoſe he cannot ſuſpend an ignorant and ſcandalous perſon Judicially, may he not therefore ſuſpend him Paſtorally?

Anſ.</hi> 1. Though I be not bound to anſwer Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his thoughts, but his arguments; yet, herein I dare refer my ſelfe to an indifferent perſon, what ſlander it is to compare any of the Ordinances to the bitter Water, which ever did good or hurt, as every Ordinance doth, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its own nature, but according to the diſpoſition of the ſubject, or the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of free grace. 2<hi>ly.</hi> I believe the Sacrament may do good, even to thoſe who are bad; upon which account all ſorts may be preſent: Only, I diſſent about actuall receiving, which if Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> can prove a converting Ordinance, he ſhall not only make me his Proſelyte, but a greater Zelot for free Admiſſion, yea, freer Admiſſion, then himſelfe is. What he repeats here and <hi>page</hi> 76. I paſſe, as having been formerly anſwered. <hi>Page</hi> 75. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> feeling himſelfe pinched with the inſtance of godly Parents and Maſters, keeping their Children and Servants from the Sacrament, till they were viſibly qualified, hath nothing to except againſt, <hi>but my ill language,</hi> as he is pleaſed to terme it. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The worſt of my ill language is to ask him, whether it be not a ſhame for one, ſcarce out of the ſhell for Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Divinity, to reflect upon ſuch eminent and pious perſons, who were Counſellours and Authors of Church-government amongſt us, <hi>As if they were children of</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>and went about with</hi> Judas <hi>to make a bargain of Chriſt at the Supper.</hi> To be a young Scholler or Divine is no reproach; but, for ſuch a one to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure an Aſſembly of ſuch Senators and Divines as he doth, I thinke is ſhamefull; if it be not, I ſhall willingly ask Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> pardon for ſaying ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:120105:70"/>As I deny not, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 77.</note> but the Word and ſeal muſt go together, ſo I am aſſured, they do both go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in every Sacrament, and that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is ſealed conditionally in every Sacrament to all the World, though the greateſt part of the VVorld do not receive. But it followes not from thence, that all may receive: Nor can Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> bring any Scripture-evidence, <hi>That men muſt come to the Sacrament to ſeal their own damnation:</hi> Yea, probably ſuch Doctrine Preached, would be a greater bar to his free Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, then the Tryall before the Elderſhip, which yet he ſo much decries. I perceive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Infants and ſcandalous perſons troubles him, which though he ſnarle at, will not budge or move their place. But that I paſſe, as having been formerly cleared. He is alſo diſpleaſed, that we go by a rule of viſibility, in admitting Church-members to the Lords Supper: But, let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> anſwer himſelfe, and either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all Church-members, or give us a better rule then the rule of viſibility, to wit, That ſuch members as are viſibly capable of the Sacrament, ſhould be admitted, others not. His rule of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is naturall intelligence, when Church-members have the uſe of Reaſon: Our rule is ſpirituall intelligence, and vacancy of ſcandall, when perſons have ſome competent knowledge of Divine and Sacramentall myſteries, and live unblamably. Will Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> in one breath cry up and cry down the rule of viſibility? If yet he ask, Where is there any ground to try Church-members, whether they be ignorant, or no, &amp;c. Let him anſwer himſelfe, Where is there any ground to try Church-members, whether they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:120105:70"/>
have the uſe of reaſon or no? Or, where doth Chriſt forbid the admitting of diſtracted perſons? If the ground be, becauſe they cannot examine themſelves, the ſame ground will reach ignorant perſons in the Church, whoſe inability for ſelfe-examination is ſo much the worſe, as it is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

To this, all he anſwers, is, that, <hi>Hiſtoricall Faith is enough to Baptiſme.</hi> As, 1. its utterly impertinent: So, 2<hi>ly.</hi> its falſe, ſince not only an Hiſtoricall Faith, but alſo profeſſion of Repentance, is neceſſary to Baptiſme, which is therefore called, The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Repentance. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 4, 5. 3<hi>ly.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith and Repentance, cannot ſtand with conviction of groſſe ignorance, and with ſcandall. We refuſe none, who make a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive profeſſion of Faith and Repentance. And here once more, let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> remember his own rule, <hi>Adultis cadem eſt ratio utriuſque Sacramenti.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In my anſwer to his ſecond conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I do not quote Scripture, therefore Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſhould either have mentioned thoſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:120105:71"/>
Scriptures, or referred the Reader to them. But, to come to the point; Will Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſtand to that aſſertion of his, <hi>That a Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers outward Acceptance, is no other but his Receiving?</hi> What thinks he of publick Prayer, Hearing, the Parents confeſſion of Faith at the Baptiſing of his Children, &amp;c. are not each of theſe an outward acceptance? Then ſure Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lords Supper, is not the ſole outward or viſible acceptance. How many Church-members will ſcarce come to Church from years end to years end, who yet would think themſelves much wronged, if the Sacrament be denyed them? Is their offering to Receive once a year, acceptance enough, who all the year after will ſcarce come to the publick Ordinances? Do not they as viſibly reject Chriſt, by neglecting to Hear, &amp;c. all the year long, as they do accept Chriſt, by comming once a year to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? 2<hi>ly.</hi> True, Receiving is an outward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Sacrament; but is it a ſufficient outward acceptance of Chriſt and Grace, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Sacrament? Then perſons <hi>jure</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, cannot be ſuſpended. Suppoſe a Church-member publickly renounce Chriſt, and yet deſire to Receive; this Wretch, by Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his rule, muſt have the Sacrament, if outward acceptance be enough. For his charging me here again with foul language, why did not Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> tranſcribe it, as a further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt me? Let the Reader peruſe <hi>page</hi> 43. 44, and 45. of my Bar, he will eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail the myſterie. The truth is, in thoſe pages I lay open his foul ſlanders, and this, forſooth, is my foul language.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:120105:71"/>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>To the Third, where are many things, I ſay</hi> 1. <hi>Though conviction is not enough to convert without grace, what then? Is it not a means therefore with it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Sure Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> forgot his own words, <hi>page</hi> 16. of his Vindication, <hi>Let a man be fully convinced of the free grace of Chriſt, his heart can ſtand it out no longer againſt his converſion.</hi> Is it not here evident, he makes full conviction alone, a meanes of converſion, yea, a ſufficient means? If a man cannot ſtand it out againſt full conviction, then full conviction is a ſufficient means of converſion. This was it, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt: To which, in his Reply, he An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>Conviction, with grace, is a means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</hi> For my part, I believe it's a means of converſion, either with, or without grace; but, not a ſufficient means. An Horſe is a means to draw a million of weight, but I hope not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means: but, if a horſe alone could draw it, he were a ſufficient means. If Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his firſt aſſertion (to which I anſwered) be true, then full conviction, even without grace, muſt be a ſufficient means of converſion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. 2<hi>ly. Conviction of the truth of the Covenant comes directly by ſealing it; and conviction of the generall offer, by applying it to every ſingle perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is a double ſealing in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: 1. By application of the Seal to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant it ſelfe. 2<hi>ly.</hi> By application of the Seal to particular perſons in their receiving. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſenſe we agree, conviction comes by ſealing the generall offer, even to thoſe who do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but may be preſent: But it followes not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:120105:72"/>
immediately, nor directly, that becauſe the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is particularly applyed to ſome perſons, therefore it is offered to all. It's bad Logick, to argue from a particular to a generall, unleſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a generall reaſon: And hence, the conſequence from a particular to a generall, is not immediate, but remote. It followes not, that becauſe pardon is by the ſeal applyed to ſome Traitors, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is offered to all Traitors: No more is it true <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that, becauſe grace is ſealed by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application to ſome perſons in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore it is offered unto all. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent indeed is true, not ſo the conſequence. In the laſt clauſe, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> is ambiguous: If by <hi>every ſingle perſon</hi> he means every man, woman, and child in the world; then undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, conviction of the generall offer, flowes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and immediately from ſuch application: But there never was, nor will be, ſuch an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. If by every ſingle perſon, he means ſome ſingle perſons of all ſorts, neither is there ſuch an application at the Sacrament, even in Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> his own judgment who excludes, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ideots, but alſo Heathen and excommunicated perſons. If by every ſingle perſon he mean only, every perſon admitted to receive, here <hi>his every perſon</hi> notes but ſome perſons in the World; nor will it follow, that becauſe the Covenant is applyed to ſome perſons, by actuall Receiving, therefore it is offered unto all? My aſſertion then holds thus far true, That conviction of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall offer of the Covenant, comes by ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and generall obſignation, not by perſonall and particular obſignation and application: which was the thing I drove at, and which Mr.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:120105:72"/>
                  <hi>Humphrey</hi> muſt evince, if he will ſpeak to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; nor is the diſtinction between offering and applying ſo nice as he would make it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. 3<hi>ly. Conviction that Chriſt is mine in particular, as to faith of particular evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, comes not at all by the Sacrament:</hi> 1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sacrament ſeales nothing, but the Word; which ſpeaks not particularly, I believe.</hi> 2<hi>ly. What is common to the hypocrite with the true believer, cannot bring any evidence to me, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Let the Reader mark it: Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> denies, that faith of evidence, comes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Word or Sacrament. 2<hi>ly.</hi> He denies it upon a Popiſh ground, becauſe the Word ſpeaks not particularly. 3<hi>ly.</hi> We grant, the Word ſaies not particularly, Thou <hi>John Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey,</hi> ſhalt be ſaved; no more doth it ſay, Thou <hi>John Humphrey,</hi> ſhalt riſe from the dead; or, Thou <hi>John Humphrey,</hi> ſhalt have no other Gods but <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Cannot Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> therefore attain to a faith of evidence, that he in particular ſhall riſe, and that its his duty in particular, to have <hi>Jehovah</hi> only for his God? 4<hi>ly.</hi> We grant, the Sacrament ſeales nothing, but the Word; but, doth not the Sacrament by ſealing ratifie the Word? And then, if the Word conduce to faith of evidence, doth not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament alſo? Take for inſtance the ſyllogiſme of Aſſurance: He that believes, ſhall be ſaved; I believe, therefore I ſhall be ſaved. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>I ſhall be ſaved,</hi> is faith of evidence. This Concluſion depends neceſſarily upon both Propoſitions: The <hi>Major</hi> is Scripture in terms, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 26. The <hi>Minor,</hi> we ſay, depends part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:120105:73"/>
upon Scripture, in reſpect of the ſignes of true faith laid down therein: According to Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> here (with whom we alſo agree) the <hi>Minor depends upon the teſtimony of my own Conſcience, and the Spirit.</hi> The Concluſion flowes neceſſarily from both: If ſo, then Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance depends in part upon Scripture, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Promiſe; this Promiſe is ratified by the Sacrament as by a Seal: and how then can Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Aſſertion hold Water, <hi>That faith of evidence comes not at all by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> If my evidence for a Poſſeſſion depend upon a Deed, and that Deed be ratified by a Seal, is it not clear, my Evidence depends much upon the Seal? Is not a Deed cancelled, by pulling off the Seales, and doth it not then depend much upon the Seales? True, Gods Word (conſidering his infallibility) is as good as his Bond; yet, to ſtrengthen our weak faith, he is pleaſed to annex Seales, &amp;c. that by ſtrong aſſurance, we might have ſtrong conſolation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18. His ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Argument, as it makes further diſcovery of Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his judgment, ſo it ſhamefully laies open his weakneſſe: It diſcovers his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he believes, no outward Ordinance can bring any evidence: it diſcovers his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in aſſerting, <hi>That nothing common to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites with believers, can bring evidence to any,</hi> which, though true in ſome ſenſe, is falſe in his ſenſe; and he may as well ſay, Nothing common to hypocrites with believers can convert, and thereby deny the power of Converſion to the Word preached. Can the Word convert, and can it not evidence converſion? Can it convince me to be in the ſtate of Nature, and can it not as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:120105:73"/>
well convince me to be in the ſtate of Grace? Can it do the greater, and can it not do the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer? True, nothing common to hypocrites with believers, can be a formall cauſe of evidence; but, divers things common to both, may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſes of evidence, I mean, as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to wit, Prayer, by impetration; the Word, by conviction; the Sacraments, by obſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and conſcience, by reflection; all back't by the Spirit as the Principle, who by the Word, &amp;c. convinces of righteouſneſſe and judgment, as well, as of ſin, <hi>John</hi> 16. 8.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I grant, the Sacraments rightly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, are infallible notes of the Church viſible; but, I queſtion whether they be eſſentiall notes, becauſe ſuch notes hold both negatively and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively. An eſſentiall note of a man, proves
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:120105:74"/>
the ſubject where it is, to be a man, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject where it is not, to be no man: Upon which account, I dare not ſay, the Sacraments are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall notes of the Church viſible, ſince a Church may be truly viſible, though it have them not for a long time: Such was the Church of thoſe Iſraelites, who were not Circumciſed in the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. <hi>ve ſ.</hi> 5, 7. which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers our Baptiſme: Nor do I doubt, but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Great was a true member of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, even before he was Baptized: The like may be ſaid of <hi>Abraham's</hi> family, before Circumciſion was inſtituted; and likewiſe of the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> who were members (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat) of the Church-viſible, yet were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to neither of the Sacraments, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever neceſſary, <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> yet are not neceſſary abſolutely <hi>neceſſitate medit,</hi> ſo their abſence proceed not from contempt.

How many Congregations have for ten or twelve years together, aſſembled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly at the Word and Prayer, without the Lords Supper, yea ſome of them, haply, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſme? A great fault I grant; but, I hope, not ſo great, as to unchurch them.</p>
               <p>I perceive, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> is too willing to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:120105:74"/>
lie at catch, who cannot forbear ſnapping at me, even when I plead for him, and excuſe him. His definition of a Church-viſible I ſhewed, was liable enough to exception; yet, took it in the beſt ſenſe, ſuppoſing he meant more then he ſaid. He defines a <hi>Church viſible, to be a number of ſuch, as make profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This definition, I ſaid, was deficient, as wanting the <hi>copula,</hi> that united them in one body; namely, <hi>Combination for Church-ends:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 81.</note> Yet, ſuppoſing this might be his meaning, though not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his definition, I paſſe it: For which he flouts me, as curious, and with a pretty ſtory, thinks to catch his Reader. But, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſhould remember, that in a Diſpute, the Reader muſt be convinced with Arguments, not caught with expreſſions. Would he play the Logician more, and the Rhetorician leſſe, naked Truth would ſooner take place. Let me ask Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey,</hi> whether the Members of the inviſible Church be not a number of Profeſſours? If ſo, VVhat diſtinguiſheth the viſible from the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, but this Combination for Church-Ends? When all the parts of a body can make a <hi>totum</hi> without <hi>union,</hi> then all the members of the Church viſible, can make a Church viſible without the former combination. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours make the Church inviſible, by inviſible combination in Chriſt; and the Church viſible, by viſible combination at the Ordinances of Chriſt, the moſt neceſſary of which, the viſible Church cannot want.</p>

Now mark, I pray: If one who is no Church-member, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and divers who are Church-members, may not be admitted to the Saceament; is it not evident, that the ground of Admiſſion to the Lords Supper, lies not properly in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip, but in viſibility, ſince a viſible Saint may be admitted, though no Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member; but divers Church-members may not be admitted, though inviſible Saints.</p>

and converſation do ſuit in ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with his profeſſion; but, he is no more a Church-member, till in union, than a beam or ſtone is part of the Houſe, till compacted with the building. This is further evident in the caſe of excommunication, whereby even a pious Church-member, may be cut off, for a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſin, yet remains ſtill, both a profeſſor, and a reall Saint: As, Suppoſe <hi>David</hi> had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated for his Murther and Adultery.

               <p>The Argument drawn from Infants and Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, which here again he flies upon with ſuch contempt and ſcorn, hath been formerly vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, to which I refer the Reader. For what he addes, <hi>That Saint</hi> Paul <hi>enjoynes us to examine our ſelves, and to diſcern the Lords Body: Nor doth it excuſe any of age, but they are both to do ſo, and come; both to prepare, and eat. We muſt do what we can ſtill, when we cannot do as we ought: But, as for Infants, &amp;c. it's no ſin of theirs, if they are not fit to come. For ignorance then, and ſcandall; if it be not ſuch as makes us forfeit our Church-memberſhip (that is, become excommunicate) it cannot contradict our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profeſſion.</hi>

By conceſſion, <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> all of age, muſt do both: But the Queſtion is, <hi>de ſenſu diviſo,</hi> whether all of age muſt receive, though they cannot, will not, receive worthily? It was a duty to kiſſe Chriſt ſincerely, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 45. but the very kiſſe was a ſin, and worſe then
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:120105:76"/>
not kiſſing, when given treacherouſly, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 48. So likewiſe to worſhip Chriſt is a duty, <hi>John</hi> 9. 38. but better not worſhip him at all, then worſhip him ironically, <hi>Matth,</hi> 27. 29. Are not all unworthy Receivers, of this Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> Again by Conceſſion. We muſt do what we can morally, but not alwaies what we can naturally, when we can not do what we would.

               <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> Suppoſe a man be drunk before the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, muſt he therefore Receive the Lords Supper, even when he is actually drunk, becauſe by this ſin of his, he wilfully made himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the Sacrament? Upon Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Principles he muſt; for, he tells us, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Ideots are excuſed, becauſe they are not wilfully unfit for the Sacrament; but, perſons of age being intelligent, muſt receive, though they be unfit, becauſe theſe are wilfully, and by their own default, unfit. Will it not hence neceſſarily follow, that the vileſt miſcreants, who are <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate, are bound to come and receive, becauſe by their foul ſcandalls, they willfully unfit themſelves for the Sacrament? And by proportion, the more vile and wilfull ſinners are, the more they are bound, to receive the Lords Supper. And therefore a perſon actually drunk, by his own default, muſt receive, even when drunk becauſe he was wilfully unfit; but, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon forced to be drunk by others, may be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:120105:76"/>
from Receiving, becauſe he did not wilfully make himſelfe unfit and uncapable. Wherefore are Ideots kept away, but becauſe they are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in underſtanding, and cannot put forth thoſe acts, which are neceſſary to worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving? Are not all groſly ignorant perſons, children alſo in underſtanding, as well as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 20. If he ſay, they are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſo, that is not true of divers, who by their luſts, break their brains, and grow diſtracted. If yet he ſay, ignorance may be cured, ſo may diſtraction and madneſſe alſo; but, till both be cured, the one by ſpirituall, the other by bodily Phyſick, I believe the one may plead admiſſion as well as the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>ly.</hi> Again, by Conceſſion. Ignorance and ſcandall do not univerſally contradict profeſſion, whether I be a Church-member or not: It's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for us, if either of them contradict pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion particularly: As, he that contradicts any one Commandement by wilfull diſobedience, though he keep the other nine; yet, really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the whole Law, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10. So he who holds up profeſſion in many things, yet, walks contrary to it in one viſible ſcandal, by that one ſcandal contradicts his whole profeſſion. He that yields up nine Forts to his Soveraigne, but keeps him out of one, is as truly a Rebell, as he that keeps him out of all. As one ſin lived in, contradicts reall holineſſe; ſo one ſin viſibly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in, contradicts viſible holineſſe, which is Profeſſion. If viſible profaneneſſe, arrayed with viſible holineſſe, muſt be admitted, then a known Wolfe, cloathed with a Lambs skin, muſt be uſed as a Lamb; and a Dog, having on a Childs
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:120105:77"/>
coat (though known to be a Dog) muſt ſit at the Table with the Children. The Tridentine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do not univerſally contradict profeſſion, yet we admit them not to our Sacraments, becauſe they contradict profeſſion in divers fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, though not univerſally: upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we look at them, as univerſally contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting profeſſion, and that juſtly. Do not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Members of our Churches raſe the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by abominable errors and practices, as well as Papiſts? And ſhall ſuch be admitted to the Lords Supper upon this poor account, becauſe they are not actually excommunicated? If ſo, then let the rankeſt Papiſts receive alſo, ſince they were never excommunicated by us. We indeed ſeparate from them, and ſo we may from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who wilfully go on in groſſe ignorance or ſcandall (though neither of them be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated) till they profeſſe their repentance. Why may not ſincere Profeſſors in a Church, as to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall Communion, ſeparate from ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Profeſſors in the ſame Church, as we do from Papiſts, though we neither excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the one nor the other. Want of ſeparation in Churches, is the cauſe, or at leaſt the occaſion, of ſeparation from Churches; and will, I fear, if not timely remedied, turn the Church of Chriſt into the Synagogue of Sathan.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>He grants my Notes, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the keeping of Children and Servants, till they can give ſome tolerable account.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I take it for granted, that the Word and Sacraments rightly adminiſtred, are true notes of the viſible Church; I do not grant the Sacrament is an eſſentiall note, and that upon the

account forementioned, becauſe the abſence of Sacraments doth not unchurch a People, but they may ſtill be a Church, as Combined, for conſtant hearing of the Word and Prayer, (in which ſenſe godly Families are true, though incompleat Churches, <hi>Philem. verſ.</hi> 2.) though at preſent they have not the uſe of Sacraments. Now let's ſee what Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſaies to my Objection: He tells us, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 83.</note> 
                  <hi>There is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what is done juridically, by compulſion, and what is done only as prudentially by advice; between forbearance and excluſion.</hi> His ground is good, <hi>Becauſe affirmative precepts oblige us,</hi> ſemper, <hi>but not</hi> ad ſemper. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>He commends godly Parents and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſo long as they follow them with inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and allowes the ſame in ſpirituall Fathers, that go no further in the like admonition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I am glad we agree thus far, that both Oeconomicall and Spirituall Parents have power in a prudentiall way, by advice, to cauſe perſons under their ſeverall charges, to forbear the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Now let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> give me any Scripture-ground to perſwade perſons, be they never ſo wicked, not to Hear and Pray. The worſt are bound to pray every day, and to Hear as often as their juſt and neceſſary occaſions will give them leave. Why ſo? Becauſe 1. Theſe are parts of naturall Worſhip, unto which all are obliged by the Law of Nature. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe theſe are means of Converſion, from which none ſhould be kept, leaſt of all the worſt, who have moſt need of Converſion. <hi>Contra,</hi> Sacraments (as ſuch) are not naturall, but inſtituted worſhip. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Not means of Converſion, but ſuppoſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:120105:78"/>
Converſion: whence perſons viſibly in the ſtate of Nature, ought not to be admitted to them.</p>
               <p n="2">But 2<hi>ly.</hi> Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſpeaks obſcurely and comes not home to the point, though what he granted make againſt himſelfe. For, the next Queſtion is, What if thoſe Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (though groſly ignorant and ſcandalous) in ſpight of admonition, will thruſt themſelves upon the Sacrament? In this Paragraph Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſaies <hi>I think a man may conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly forbear his comming ſometimes upon many occaſions, and much more upon pious ends, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding preparation.</hi> You ſee now the mans <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

For our parts, we are clear, 1. That perſons unworthy ought to forbear; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of Evangelicall unworthineſſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when ſenſible; I mean, one who hath no faith and repentance, eſpecially when convinced he hath them not. 2<hi>ly.</hi> So long as he continues in this condition, he ought to forbear. If upon ſelfe examination he apprehend himſelfe (though falſely to be in the ſtate of Grace, then his caſe is the ſame with his who thinks a ſin to be a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who of neceſſity muſt ſin, whether he act or act not; in that, againſt the rule; in this, againſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:120105:78"/>
his Conſcience: Or, as he who received the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover, thinking himſelfe clean, yet, was really unclean. If he came not, he ſinned againſt his conſcience; if he came he ſinned againſt the rule: yet, this neceſſity of ſinning is only hypotheticall, not abſolute. 3<hi>ly.</hi> If Oeconomicall Parents know their Children or Servants to be groſly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or ſcandalous, they ought not only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, but alſo to improve their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to keep ſuch (being <hi>in ſtatu quo</hi>) from the Sacrament. 4<hi>ly.</hi> It lies upon Oeconomicall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to make ſearch, who are groſly ignorant and ſcandalous in their families, by Catechiſing and watching over their Children and Servants, and in the uſe of private, as well as publick means, to bring them to ſome competent meaſure of knowledge, and at leaſt, to profeſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, before they ſuffer them to Receive, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 27. And why Spirituall Parents ſhould not do the ſame (there being the ſame ground of the one as of the other) a ſolid reaſon cannot be given: Both are betruſted with ſoules, both muſt take care to prepare thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their charge for the Sacrament; which is impoſſible for them to do (at leaſt, in reſpect of divers, both Children Servants, and People) if in ſpight of Parents, perſons, though never ſo ignorant and ſcandalous, might thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe he laies ſo much ſtreſſe upon kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping perſons from the Sacrament, <hi>uridicall, and by compulſion:</hi> I believe it would puzzle Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> to prove, that we have kept any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in that manner. Divers of our people will not come to Sacraments, though they may:
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:120105:79"/>
others deſire to come, but will not ſubmit to try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: Such we intreat to excuſe us, and thereupon they abſtain, though with diſcontent. But where have we <hi>juridically, or by compulſion,</hi> kept any from the Sacrament? If there be any ſuch thing amongſt us, I am confident it is very rare. I wiſh Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> were ſo good a friend as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, to this prudentiall care of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours about the Sacrament; then would he perſwade people upon prudence, to ſubmit to tryall, and not blow up the diviſion between Paſtour and People, by crying out ſo cauſleſly, <hi>Violence and Compulſion.</hi> Where any benefit or priviledge is offered, upon fair and honourable conditions, and, upon ſleighting the condition, is denyed, will Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> look at ſuch a condition as compulſion? Or, if any refuſing the condition, ſhall catch at the Commodity by violence, may not his violence be repelled with violence; &amp; in ſuch caſe, is not the former charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with violence, rather then the latter? Yet, God be thanked, we have no ſuch cuſtome; but, we have reaſon to fear, that Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Book may put heady people upon waies of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in order to the Sacrament, though he drive no ſuch deſigne in the publication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> being urged with the Book of Common-Prayer, anſwers, <hi>As for the Rubricks allowing the Miniſter to ſuſpend ſome notorious evill livers, I take it upon the account of</hi> ipſo jure <hi>excommunicate, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>

not ſuffering them to be partakers of the Lords Table, &amp;c.</hi> 2<hi>ly.</hi> The object of the Suſpenſion is not only adulterers, &amp;c. but, <hi>malicious, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ignorant perſons; yea, ſuch as wrong their neighbours, in word or deed, and will not be perſwaded to make them reparation;</hi> all which indeed are very great ſins, though too rife in, and ſlighted by, many Profeſſours and Church-members. And particularly for perſons groſly ignorant, I appeal to the form of confirmation, which gives charge for their ſuſpenſion in theſe words, <hi>There ſhall none be admitted unto the holy Communion, untill ſuch time as he can ſay the Catechiſm:</hi> In order whereunto, both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Governours of Families are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to be diligent in point of inſtruction, and then to return the names of perſons ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, to the Biſhop, that he might examine and approve them. From all which, compared with Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his preſent Explication and Interpretation, I conclude, That either ignorant and envious perſons are <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate; or, that perſons may be ſuſpended, though not <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate.</p>

Thence I gather, That in Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an hypocrite may evidently and certainly

be diſcerned. If ſo, then I hope we may judge ſome mens hearts to be naught, without entring upon Gods Throne, or prying into Gods ſecrets; an heavy charge he laid formerly upon us.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> It's Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his judgment, that though it be certainly known a perſon is a wicked man, in the ſtate of nature, and in the gall of bitterneſſe (for ſuch are all who have no ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) yet, he muſt be admitted to the Sacrament, ſo he be a Church-member.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Suppoſe this charge were true, may not I urge him with that Authority, I conceive he ownes, becauſe I own not the ſame Authority. Were I a Jew, and deſpiſed the new Teſtament; yet, I hope, it would not be irrationall for me to preſſe him, being a Chriſtian, with the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. 2<hi>ly.</hi> His Charge is falſe; I deſpiſe not the Book of Common-Prayer, though I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove not divers things in it and about it; and for which, I have both ſolid reaſon, the conſent of the moſt pious in the Nation, and both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament to back me. As to the point in hand: If the Exhortation in the Communion
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:120105:80"/>
make it utterly unlawfull to be preſent, unleſſe we receive; I muſt crave liberty to diſſent from it in that particular, and muſt oppoſe to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the practice of the Primitive Church. But, may there not be a candid interpretation of that Paſſage? The Exhortation is but againſt thoſe, who ſleight and neglect the Sacrament, and withall ſtand by as <hi>Gazers.</hi> Compare <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 11. who may come and will not. This certainly is a great ſin. But will Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> thence conclude, that becauſe ſome may not taſte, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may not hear and ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the Sacrament? Shall I not come as near the Lord as I can, becauſe I cannot come ſo near him as I would?</p>

For the New-Teſtament, That all Church-members have a mediate right to the Lords Supper, we grant, and Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> diſputes eagerly for it, making Church-memberſhip the formall ground thereof. That all Church-members have not an immediate right, is evident; 1. In Infants and Ideots. 2<hi>ly.</hi> From that famous place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>You cannot drink of the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devills, &amp;c.</hi> He ſpeaks to Church-members; and that <hi>Cannot</hi> holds forth, not a naturall, but morall impoſſibility: for, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is unlawfull, is morally impoſſible. Thoſe Church-members then, who drank of the Devills Cup at the Idols Temple, might not drink of the Lords Cup at the Sacrament. They had then a mediate right as Church-members; but, not an immediate right, becauſe defiled by the Idol-Feaſt. His cavills againſt this place have been formerly anſwered. I might here add for confirmation, the practice of the Primitive Church, and our own Church, in not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Church-members, till they had competent knowledge, and were free from ſcandall: But, I forbear repetitions.</p>
               <p>Thoſe three thouſand he ſpeaks of, <hi>Acts</hi> 2, had competent knowledge, and by profeſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance cleared themſelves of ſcandall.

Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are not excommunicated as Saints, but as Sinners; nor as ſinners abſolutely, but as viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinners; elſe, where is Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate? What is viſible ſin, but viſible unworthineſſe? And though all viſible unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:120105:82"/>
do not make me Evangelically unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; yet, viſible unworthineſſe in dominion, doth. This Dominion is either Tyrannicall, by ſome enormous act waſting the Conſcience: or, Regall, when a perſon is in the ſtate of ſin; both which make him Tareiſh, and if viſible, a viſible Tare, to be pluckt up (though in order to cure, if poſſible) by the hands of Excommunication. By Tares then, are meant, perſons viſibly wicked in the Church, (be it habitually or actually) <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27, 38. compare <hi>John</hi> 8 34. Theſe Tares Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> will by no means have pluckt up. We Anſwer, Then farewell Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, which is a plucking up of the Tares. This Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> doth not anſwer, (leaving Chriſt to anſwer for himſelfe, if he pleaſe) yet is reſolved to hold the Concluſion. What hereſie may not paſſe for current if Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Diſinity be good? For inſtance, The Anthropomorphites teach, that God is a Body, and that, becauſe eyes, ears, hands, &amp;c. are attributed to him in Scripture. We reply, God is a Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 4. 24. and therefore cannot be a Body. How eaſily now, may they with Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> hold the Concluſion ſtill, and ſay, There is no doubt of Gods reconciling his own Truth. God will indeed reconcile his owne Truth and Ordinances, be we never ſo negligent to reconcile them; but we can expect but little thanks from God and Chriſt, if either through careleſſeneſſe or prejudice, we do not our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reconcile them. For the Satisfaction therefore of tender Conſciences, whom Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> leaves in a confuſed maze of doubt: Know 1. Its true in ſome ſenſe, that the Tares
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:120105:83"/>
muſt not be plucked up, for the Scripture ſaies it, and the Scripture cannot be broken, <hi>John</hi> 10. 35. 2<hi>ly.</hi> In ſome ſenſe it is true, the Tares muſt be plucked up, becauſe Excommunication (which is a plucking up of Tares) is a Scripture-Ordinance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5, 7. The termes are ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly, but not really, contradictory: <hi>The Tares muſt not be plucked up;</hi> and, <hi>the Tares muſt be plucked up.</hi> As others of the like nature, <hi>God ſees no ſin in his Children;</hi> and, <hi>God ſees ſin in his Children. The Church is without ſpot;</hi> and, <hi>the Church is ſpotted, &amp;c.</hi> all which are only ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly contradictory, becauſe not underſtood under the ſame reſpect. For the difficulty about plucking up, or not plucking up, the Tares, we cannot have a better Reconciler than Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 29. where the ground of the Prohibition, is the rule and bound of the Prohibition. From thence I gather, 1. That the Prohibition is not abſolute, but with a caution, <hi>Leſt you pluck up the Wheat alſo,</hi> how ever Mr. <hi>Humphrey, page</hi> 89. is pleaſed to judge of it, and in the cloſe, to favour me with a jeſt. 2<hi>ly.</hi> That men viſibly wicked muſt be tolerated in the Church, rather then perſons viſibly godly ſhould be prejudiced, by raſh and prepoſterous rigour, againſt wicked Church-members; as it fell out by the Anabaptiſts: See <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi> upon the place.</p>
               <p>Others think, the Tares in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> were like the Wheat, whence there might be danger of eradicating the Wheat with them. But, its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the Servants knew the Tares, and were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with them (whether by ſervants you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Church-Officers, or other diſcerning
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:120105:83"/>
Church-members) whence it ſeemes to follow, that either ſome may be known to be Tares, who cannot juridically be proved to be ſo; and ſuch was the caſe of <hi>Judas:</hi> Or, though they can be proved to be ſuch, yet, circumſtances may ſo fall out, that juſt ſeverity againſt them, by way of excommunication, may be noxious to the godly: In which caſes, ſuch Tares muſt be patiently tolerated, till either God open a dore for the Church to caſt them out, or deal with them himſelfe by particular or generall judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 3<hi>ly.</hi> That Church-members may be known to be wicked, and in the ſtate of nature, without danger of entring upon Gods Throne; This Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> grants here, and the Parable holds it forth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 26, 27. however he diſpute againſt it elſe-where. 4<hi>ly.</hi> That where wicked men may be cut off without prejudice to the godly, there the plucking up of thoſe Tares is not prohibited by the Parable; this will be done at the day of Judgment, hath been done, and may be done by excommunication. 5<hi>ly.</hi> That a Miniſters knowledge of a man to be a Tare, is not enough to caſt him out of the Church, ſince its of great concernment, that the Wheat (as well as the Servants) ſhould know the Tares: that the Congregation (as well as Church-Officers) ſhould be ſatisfied, a perſon is a Tare, before he be pluckt up, which order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved, there can be no ſuch danger of plucking up the Wheat. A Miniſter may ſuſpend a poſitive Act, in not giving the Sacrament to ſuch a perſon for the preſent; but, he cannot put forth a poſitive Act, to cut off ſuch a perſon from the Church, without conſent or ſatisfaction
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:120105:84"/>
of the Church, at leaſt, repreſentative. And, if in the former caſe, the Miniſter do wrong through miſtake or paſſion, &amp;c. himſelfe is accountable to the Church for that particular injury; and the perſon ſo wronged, ought to be righted by the Church. If Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> can reconcile the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable better with excommunication, we ſhall have cauſe to thank him: If not, I ſhall intreat him not to ſcoff at what he cannot mend: But, however he ſhall pleaſe to deal with me, let him remember, it's a Miniſters duty to ſatisfie, not to encreaſe, the ſcruples of tender Conſciences; eſpecially when his profeſt deſigne is, the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of tender Conſciences. When two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſeem to claſh, is it fit for a Miniſter to leave them together by the ears, and ſay, <note place="margin">

though granted, his own party being judges) as he concludes in expreſſe termes, <hi>What need more be urged, but that men, when they are willing not to ſee, will let any hand (put over their eies) be enough to blind them.</hi> By this raſh cenſure of his, I noted, that 1.

In all this, 1. Where is there any forgery, unleſſe the quotation of his own words be a forgery? 2<hi>ly.</hi> Where is the leaſt word of curſing him, or of devoting him irrecoverably to the pit of Hell? <hi>I, but in my ſenſe it is ſo. Anſ.</hi> Let the Reader judge, if herein Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> deal charitably with me: I charge him only with his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe termes; he charges me with that, of which I wrote not one tittle, meerly upon jealouſie of my ſenſe and meaning. 2<hi>ly.</hi> He charges me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly as entring into Gods ſecrets; yet, here takes upon him to enter into Gods ſecrets, and to judge of my heart and meaning, where my words bear no ſuch thing. 3<hi>ly.</hi> He charges me with curſing him, and devoting him to the pit of Hell irrecoverably, who had not one tittle in my book, nor owne thought in my heart to that purpoſe. <hi>I, but all this is implyed, when I ſay, he deſerves more then ſuſpenſion. Anſ.</hi> 1. I ſay more againſt my ſelfe, and the Presbyterians in generall, upon ſuppoſition, that we were guilty
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:120105:86"/>
of Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his charge; namely, that then we were in the high way to the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and deſerved not only to be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but alſo to be excommunicated. 2<hi>ly.</hi> I ſaid not peremptorily, that he deſerved more then ſuſpenſion but, that <hi>I feared</hi> he deſerved more then ſuſpenſion. 3<hi>ly.</hi> Had I ſaid, he deſerved for this his uncharitableneſſe everlaſting damnation, (ſuppoſing he were ſo uncharitable, of which, let the Reader judge by his own words) I ſaid no more then the truth, unleſſe it be falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that an uncharitable act deſerves damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 4<hi>ly.</hi> If the ſaying, that ſuch or ſuch a ſin deſerves damnation, be the curſing of a perſon guilty thereof, or the devoting of him to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then I cannot tell a man, his ſin deſerves hell and curſe, but in that very act I curſe him, and devote him to the pit of hell; and ſo the greateſt act of charity, ſhall be made the fouleſt act of uncharitableneſſe. 5<hi>ly.</hi> As my words bear no ſuch curſed ſenſe, as Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> pins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, ſo I here profeſſe, that in thoſe words, I was far from curſing, or devoting him to the pit of hell; but, did apprehend indeed that ſuch an uncharitable cenſure of the Churches of Chriſt at home and abroad, deſerved a higher degree of excommunication then ſuſpenſion is. And if Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> or any elſe, can make it out, that therein I have been uncharitable, I ſhall willingly cry both God and him mercy, and be ready to make as publick reparation, as I have given thereby publick offence. I never, to my remembrance, heard before now, that to ſay, a man deſerves excommunication, is a curſing of him, and a devoting of him, irrecoverably, to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:120105:86"/>
the pit of Hell, nor do I believe, that the Apoſtle, by excommunicating the inceſtuous Corinth, did either curſe him, or devote him to the pit of Hell, but deſigned rather to bring him to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. Whereas therefore, <hi>page</hi> 90. he makes his appeal to Heaven in theſe words, <hi>Judge me, O Lord, try me, if herein there be any iniquityin me:</hi> I ſhall not wiſh him ſo ill as he wiſnes himſelfe, but do hartily beg of God, that he would pleaſe to open his eyes, and pardon this, and all other his iniquities; and if this be uncharitable, I ſhall thank Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey,</hi> or any elſe, for ſuch uncharitableneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me.</p>

               <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> In charging us to ſet up a diſcriminating Ordinance, he ſeemes to deny, that Church-Ordinances are diſcriminating: If that be his meaning, I apprehend it is erroneous, ſince eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordinance is diſcrinſinating in ſome ſenſe, as in an other ſenſe every Ordinance is common.

The Word is common to all, yet, not every part of the Word; the Sacraments are common to all, yet, not every part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, namely, not the participating part.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>ly.</hi> Becauſe here Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> chargeth us, with ſetting up an Ordinance of our own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by pleading for the divine right of Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I ſhall therefore briefly by one or two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, endeavour to wipe off this aſperſion; and prove, that Suſpenſion is not an human inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a divine inſtitution: I ſhall only premiſe, that Suſpenſion is either Juridicall or Paſtorall, Affirmative or Negative; the latter branch of the diſtinction being granted, the former will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, ſince what a Miniſter may, or ought, either to do, or omit, as he is a Miniſter;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:120105:87"/>
much more may he, or ought he, to do, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that particular, upon the vote and ſentence of the Elderſhip. And here, upon ſecond thoughts, I muſt a little correct what I delivered in my Bar to Free Admiſſion, <hi>page</hi> 47. namely, <hi>That the Miniſter hath not power of himſelfe to admit or keep back, without judiciall Proceſſe, wherein himſelfe cannot be both Judge and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> I delivered it then with ſome heſitancy, and do now apprehend it to be a miſtake, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably both a Ruling and Teaching El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hath at leaſt a Paſtorall power of trying and judging; and if the Evidence be clear of it ſelfe, or by ſufficient witneſſe, he may ſuſpend his own Act, of giving ſuch a perſon the Sacrament, till either the party be better qualified, or the matter do come to a juridicall proceſſe. Theſe things premiſed, the Argument ſtands thus. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The firſt Argument.</hi>
                  </note> Non-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſome intelligent Church-members is commanded by Chriſt, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Suſpenſion is commanded by Chriſt. The Conſequence is clear, becauſethe formality of Suſpenſion lies in non-admiſſion to the Sacrament; and, let us have but this, we ſhall not much contend about the manner of managing it, whether by a juridicall act or otherwiſe. This is further proved by the very terme: What is Suſpenſion in the very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, but a demur or forbearance at preſent, to give unto a perſon the thing he deſires? The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved thus, Non-admiſſion of a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is a Fornicator, &amp;c, is commanded, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Non-admiſſion of ſome intelligent Church-member is commanded. The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is clear, 1. Becauſe <hi>Brother</hi> is oppoſed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:120105:88"/>
to them without, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>verſe</hi> 10, 11. and therefore this Brother is a Church-member. 2<hi>ly.</hi> That he is an intelligent Church-member may be clearly evinced (ſhould Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> deny it) ſince divers luſts there mentioned are not practicable by any, but grown perſons. The Aſſumption I prove thus: Not to eat the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a Brother that is a Fornicator, &amp;c. is commanded. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Non-admiſſion of a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is a Fornicator, &amp;c. is commanded. The Conſequence is valid, becauſe of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary connexion between the Non admiſſion of ſuch a perſon to eat with me, and my not eating with him. If I muſt not eat with a perſon, then (as far as in me lies) I muſt not admit that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to eat with me; for his eating with me, and my eating with him being Correlates, if you grant one, you muſt of neceſſity grant both, ſince he cannot eat with me, but I muſt eat with him; nor can I eat with him, but he muſt eat with me. The Antecedent I prove from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>If any man that is called a Brother be Fornicator, &amp;c. with ſuch a one, no, not to eat.</hi> All that can rationally be objected againſt this proof, is, <hi>That by eating here, is not meant Sacramentall eating, the indefinite Propoſition being not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood univerſally.</hi>

The diſcovery of <hi>Judas</hi> was extraordinary, by immediate revelation: And, ſhould God immediately diſcover an unworthy Receiver to a Miniſter, I queſtion, whether without an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate command, this Miniſter might ſuſpend ſuch a perſon. <hi>Achan</hi> was not cenſured immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon divine revelation, but upon evidence of the fact, and his own confeſſion. We ſee that for all our Saviours diſcovery, <hi>Judas</hi> ſeemed to deny the charge, in that queſtion, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> and the Apoſtles were very inclinable to a good opinion of him. Suppoſe God ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately diſcover an Hypocrite to a Miniſter, and upon that diſcovery, this Miniſter ſhould ſuſpend that Hypocrite; might not the Elders or Congregation deſire evidence againſt the party ſo ſuſpended; and would the Miniſters plea of divine revelation, ſatisfie the Congregation, in caſe the party ſo ſuſpended, denyed the charge? Yea, if this Doctrine were good, might not a Miniſter upon pretence of divine revelation, take liberty to charge any with Hypocriſie, and to ſuſpend them at pleaſure? I wiſh, upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that thoſe who will be tryed by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter alone, and not before the Elderſhip, would ſeriouſly conſider, what a ſnare they put both themſelves and their Miniſter upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> As the diſcovery was extraordinary, ſo our Saviour acted extraordinarily in admiſſion and other circumſtances, that concerned this firſt Sacrament: As 1.

And why may not Chriſt as well act extraordinarily, in admitting a known Hypocrite? If Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> will tie us to imitate Chriſt in one of theſe, why not in all of them? I might add, that if Chriſts practice in admitting <hi>Judas</hi> be our rule, then it were a ſin to excommunicate any, ſince Chriſt did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate <hi>Judas,</hi> though he knew <hi>Judas</hi> deſerved excommunication as well as ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Argum.</hi>
                  </note>My ſecond Argument for Suſpenſion (which is alſo Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> his Argument) is this: It's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to admit ſome intelligent Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the Lords Supper: <hi>Ergo,</hi> They ought to be ſuſpended. The Conſequence is clear, ſince <hi>to admit,</hi> and <hi>not to admit,</hi> are termes contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; and therefore, if the one be unlawfull, the other muſt needs be a duty: Now Suſpenſion in its formall Nature, is a <hi>non</hi>-admiſſion; and therefore if it be unlawfull to admit, it is a duty to ſuſpend. The <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus: It's unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to admit thoſe who cannot eat of the Lords Supper: ſome intelligent Church-members can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat of the Lords Supper: <hi>Ergo.</hi> By perſons that cannot receive, I underſtand thoſe who are morally uncapable, and who (if they be of age) fin by their very receiving, as being forbidden
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:120105:92"/>
to partake of the Lords Supper, becauſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they are viſibly unworthy by groſſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or ſcandall; as well as Heathen are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to receive, upon the account of being no Church-members. Both have a naturall, but neither of them have a morall power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: Nor is an Heathen in expreſſe termes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to receive the Lords Supper, but only by conſequence, as are unworthy Church-members. This premiſed, the <hi>Major</hi> is evident, upon the very explication of the termes: for, if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to admit thoſe, who ſin by their very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, then it is unlawfull to admit thoſe, who cannot eat of the Lords Supper in a morall ſenſe, ſince that, and that only, is morally impoſſible which is ſinfull. Compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 9. <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 16. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. 19. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. they had all naturall, but no morall power, to do the things there mentioned; yet they ſay abſolutely, <hi>They cannot do</hi> ſuch and ſuch things. Thoſe places, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 16. and <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9. 21. are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>He may not,</hi> and, <hi>We may not,</hi> &amp;c. but in the Originall it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he cannot, and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we cannot &amp;c. or, ſhall not be able. This is the more remarkable, becauſe the ſame phraſe is uſed about the Paſſover, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Certain men were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the Paſſover on that day. Moſes,</hi> in the Old Teſtament ſaies, <hi>You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat the Paſſover, and touch the dead body of a man. Paul,</hi> in the New Teſtament, ſaies, <hi>You cannot partake of the Table of the Lord, and of the Table of Devills.</hi> In both, the <hi>Cannot</hi> is morall, not naturall. An unclean man might not eat of the Paſſover; one in communion with
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:120105:93"/>
Devills, might not receive the Lords Supper. Now that all intelligent Church members have not a morall power to receive, is evident by the words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>Ye cannot drink the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills; ye cannot be partaker, of the Table of the Lord, and the Table of Devills.</hi> Undoubtedly they had a naturall power to eat the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bread, &amp;c. but they had not a morall power becauſe, being under the guilt of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Idolls, it was unlawfull for them at that time to eat. The Steward ſins againſt his Lord, in giving bread to thoſe of the Family, or otherwiſe, who ought not to eat it. Doth Chriſt, the Maſter of the Family, ſay I will not have ſuch a one to eat of my Supper; and dare any Miniſter ſay to that perſon, Take and eat? If the Lord ſay, its morally impoſſible for ſuch a one to eat, he ſaies, its unlawfull for him to eat. And what a man muſt not do, that no man muſt tempt him to do, nor permit him to do, when he can lawfully hinder it: But, Church-Officers may very lawfully and eaſily hinder thoſe from partaking, who may not partake; and ſuch are all who have fellowſhip with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills. Now fellowſhip with Devills is either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite, as in Witches, &amp;c. or implicite, when men drive the Devills trade, and do the works of Sathan willingly, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. From which number, I know not how perſons groſly and wilfully ignorant and ſcandalous, (eſpecially after due admonition) can be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Sure I am, they communicate more with Devills, then did the Corinthians, who are of the Idolls Feaſts, in the Idoll Temples, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:120105:93"/>
any intention to honour the Idoll; as judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that under the Goſpell there was no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, either of meats or of places: Yet, even theſe are forbid by the Apoſtle to receive the Lords Supper, when they feaſted at the Idolls Temples. The Argument ſtands thus: He that hath communion with Devills, cannot (that is, ought not to) partake of the Lords Table. All groſly ignorant and ſcandalous perſons have communion with Devills: <hi>Ergo,</hi> No ſuch ought to receive: And, if they ought not to partake, ſurely the Miniſter ought not to admit them, and therefore he muſt needs ſuſpend them.</p>
               <p>This I might further illuſtrate and confirm, by comparing 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>With ſuch an one, no, not to eat,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>You cannot partake of the Lords Table.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>This is not to eat the Lords Supper;</hi> or (as its rendred in the Margent) <hi>Ye cannot eat, &amp;c.</hi> The Verb ſubſtantive <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. If I may not partake with other of Gods People, nor they with me, ſurely I muſt be ſuſpended; for what is Suſpenſion really, but non-Admiſſion?</p>
               <p>By what hath been delivered, I hope it will appear, that the Sacrament is a diſcriminating Ordinance, as to the point of receiving; and that Suſpenſion is not an human invention, but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, which (as other Ordinances) may be diſpenced with love and humility, if the diſpencers thereof be wiſe, holy, and humble perſons, that make conſcience to judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more then others; and when ever, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Office, they are called, to try and judge others.</p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:120105:94"/>
of Suſpenſion or Abſtention, See in Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> his <hi>Vindic. &amp;c.</hi> The ground, why I pitched upon the two forementioned Arguments, was, becauſe I apprehend they come neerer the point, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their ſcope, but alſo in the very letter. Now, leſt the Reader ſhould think we go alone, or have only ſome few inconſiderable perſons to abet us in this cauſe, I ſhall take a little pains to evidence the contrary.

               <p>In the antient Lyturgy, the Miniſter, before the Sacrament, cryed out, <hi>Sancta Sanctis.</hi> See other teſtimonies of the Fathers, cited there by <hi>Aeſtius,</hi> and ſeverall arguments he uſes, to prove, that no naturall man ought to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:120105:98"/>
why doth not Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> perſwade the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſubmit to ſuch tryall, which, we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perſwaded, would ſoon put an end to the controverſy. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> cannot be ignorant, that too many will not admit tryall upon any termes. 2<hi>ly.</hi> What if upon tryall in order to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and counſell, the party tryed, be found groſly ignorant or ſcandalous? Is he not, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> upon ſuch diſcovery, made by tryall, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unworthy above ſuſpition? And muſt the Church, notwithſtanding this apparent unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſſe, admit ſuch an one? Yet, even here, our ordinary courſe is, rather to adviſe and counſell, then to ſuſpend. And if upon ſcandall proved, they teſtify their repentance, we dare not refuſe them, or, if upon conviction of groſſe ignorance, they deſire to be further inſtructed, we doubt not, through Gods mercy, in a month or two, to inſtill ſo much knowledge, as may ſtand with truth of grace, and ſo make them vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly worthy; leaving the ſecrets of the heart to Gods judgment alone, unleſſe hypocriſie break out viſibly afterwards. What he addes, <hi>page</hi> 92. and 93. either it hath been already anſwered, or makes not againſt us; ſince Suſpenſion is no prejudice to the firmneſſe of Excommunication, but either a degree of it, (if juridically paſſed) a preparative to it, or a charitable prevention of it, by bringing a perſon to himſelfe and his duty; and, happy that Church, who by ſuch an <hi>inciſion,</hi> can for ever foreſtall <hi>exciſion.</hi> We think, as well as Mr. <hi>Humphrey, It were a wretched Interpretation to ſay, the Church could not bear evill perſons only at the Sacrament;</hi> but, it's a good Interpretation to ſay, She cannot bear them
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:120105:98"/>
at the Sacrament, though not only there: For, after Suſpenſion, the Church hath patience, to ſee if that will amend the Offender; if not, She may proceed to Excommunication. So that his cenſure of me, <hi>page</hi> 63. he builds, partly upon his own miſreport of my words, both, as to the matter and manner of expreſſion; partly upon his own miſtake, who makes Sacramentall tryall (as we hold it forth) the cauſe of diverſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects, of which, it's only the <hi>occaſion;</hi> but the proper cauſes are, the ignorance or pride of too many, not only Refuſers, but even Tryers and Judges.</p>

               <p>Here 1. is not one word of <hi>Korah.</hi> 2<hi>ly.</hi> Halfe an eye of charity will eaſily ſee, that in thoſe expreſſions, I looked at Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> as a true Jew, rather then a Samaritan. 3<hi>ly.</hi> Yet
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:120105:99"/>
with griefe I declared my apprehenſion, that by his Treatiſe of free Admiſſion, he hath done ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Samaritans rather than to true Jewes. This is my judgment ſtill, not only of Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> but of the godlieſt under Heaven, who ſome way or other, firſt or laſt, by error or practice, are too ſubſervient to <hi>Sanballat,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, to 15. And herein I am far from excepting my ſelfe, being the weakeſt of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. If Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Tenet be erroneous, ſure he hath done <hi>Sanballat</hi> ſervice: If his Tenet be true. I confeſſe I have done <hi>Sanballat</hi> ſervice, in oppoſing it. Let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> or any make this good, I ſhall thank them for their pains and be the firſt ſhall put fire to my ney and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I hope the pious and judicious Reader will not count this bitter cenſoriouſneſſe; no nor Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> neither, upon a ſecond review. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge Sacramentall tryall a truth, but I muſt needs judge the oppoſite Doctrine an errour, and by conſequence, that they who promote it, do work for <hi>Sanballat,</hi> as to that act; however, as to their perſons, they may be true Jewes. Let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſay as much of me, I ſhall not think him cenſorious at all, much leſſe bitterly cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>page</hi> 65. I ſpeak theſe words to Mr. <hi>Humphrey, Let him take heed, leſt in this raſh cenſure he be not like</hi> Korah <hi>and his Company.</hi> Yet 1.

If he ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> was not called effectually while he was proud; True, no more was he called immediately to ſaving repentance, till he was legally humbled. As therefore Chriſt called not <hi>Paul</hi> to Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall repentance effectually, till he was legally humbled; ſo he tendred not ſaving grace im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to him, as proud, but as legally hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, which is a middle thing, between a proud <hi>Paul</hi> and a converted <hi>Paul.</hi> Chriſt tenders grace mediately to the proud ſinner, immediately to the humbled ſinner, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. nor doth he call the proud ſinner effectually, till humbled, and by humiliation.

elſe, what mean thoſe words, <hi>page</hi> 20. of his Vindication, <hi>To give weight to this</hi> (diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on his third Reaſon,) <hi>remember three paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of our Saviours.</hi> Now the laſt of thoſe three, is the inſtance of the Adulterous woman, <hi>John</hi> 8.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. We think our ſelves bound to look after thoſe trialls, which are 1. Negative. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Senſible; as groſſe ignorance, heatheniſh profanneſſe, viſible impenitency, which is walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a tract or courſe of any ſcandalous ſin, or falling into ſome foul abomination, which argues at leaſt the tyranny of fin. By ſuch effects as theſe, we may ſafely judge a perſon Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically unworthy, without prying into his heart, or into Gods ſecrets, which is impoſſible for the Creature to do, and ſinfull to attempt it: Did <hi>Peter</hi> pry into <hi>Simon Magus</hi>'s his heart, when he ſaid, I perceive thee to be in the gall of bitterneſſe, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 32? Or did <hi>Philip</hi> pry into the Eunuchs heart, when he put him to it about the reality of his faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 37? If Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> will condemn us for the like practice, our comfort is, we have good warrant to bear us out, and good company to ſuffer with us, under this imputation of his.

Further, let the Reader take notice, that, however Mr. <hi>Humphrey, page</hi> 102. is pleaſed to favour me with a jeſt, for denying, that Profeſſion in his ſenſe, is the rule of Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; yet, he only ſaies, but proves not, <hi>That ſuch profeſſion is the ordinary road of Chriſtians;</hi> a Tenet contrary to Scripture, to Antiquity, and the late, as well as preſent practice of our Church. (Here let the Reader know, that Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> takes a piece of Profeſſion, namely, Baptiſme, and comming to Church, for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground of Admiſſion to the Lords Supper.) We deny not, that compleat Profeſſion is enough for Admiſſion; but, ſuch Profeſſors muſt have 1.

As knowledge and pious carriage will
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:120105:103"/>
not make one a compleat Profeſſor, unleſſe he be Baptized and attend ordinarily upon the publick Ordinances. So Baptiſme and attendance upon the publick Ordinances will not make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Profeſſor, unleſſe competent knowledge, and pious converſation, be ſuperadded. When a halfe houre is an whole hour, then an halfe Profeſſor may go for an whole Profeſſor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>Page</hi> 102. <hi>Chriſt tells us of no medium, while he divides all his gueſts into the Called and Choſen,</hi> Matth. 22. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Doth not the Parable expreſly mention two ſorts of Gueſts called, beſides thoſe that were choſen? 1. They, who made light of the very Call, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. 2<hi>ly.</hi> Such as came, and were not diſcerned by the very Servants, yet wanted the Wedding Garment, <hi>verſe</hi> 11. and what are theſe laſt but <hi>medium participationis,</hi> ſo much decryed by Mr. <hi>Humphrey.</hi> 1. Were not they Profeſſors who ſlighted the Call? (unleſſe he will ſay, that the Jewes and Phariſees, againſt whom the Parable was directed, were not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors) 2<hi>ly.</hi> Was not this their ſlighting viſible to the Servants? Compare <hi>verſe</hi> 7. and <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 21. And doth it not thence neceſſarily follow, that there are ſome Profeſſors, that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fibly reject the grace of the Goſpell; ſome, that cordially accept thereof? And between both theſe (as a middle of participation) are they, who friendly accept of grace offered, and viſibly walk up to it, as did he that came without the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment, whom neither the Servants, nor the other Gueſts, diſcerned, but only the Maſter of the Feaſt. Withall the Reader may note, that the Feaſt in this Parable is not the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:120105:103"/>
(this Parable being delivered by Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords Supper was inſtituted) but the offer of Chriſt, and the grace of the Goſpell in generall, which is openly ſleighted by ſome, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by others, and by ſome of theſe feignedly, by others cordially. Some Profeſſors reject Chriſt offered both outwardly and inwardly; ſome accept him both outwardly and inwardly: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both theſe (as a middle of participation) are they, who accept Chriſt outwardly, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him inwardly, as do all caſed Hypocrites. It's evident then, that Chriſt, in this Parable, ownes a middle of participation between both extreams.</p>
               <p>By the way take notice, how again, <hi>page</hi> 103. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> is pleaſed to put off my inſtance of Children with a jeſt, which at good earneſt will be too hard for him: His wit and mirth may tickle the Reader, and make his Books the more vendible. But I ſhall not tire the Reader, with repeating what I have ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, in order to the vindication of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>For that other Argument of mine, to prove Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his Principle looſe, becauſe it will open a dore for the wickedeſt varlets: Hear what Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſaies to it, <hi>page</hi> 103. <hi>He ſhould ſay in plain termes, it is a looſe Principle, becauſe it is not his Principle, and then he had hit it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>D. Dr.</hi> If profeſſion be Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his ground, how dare he excommunicate any Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſon, though moſt wicked?</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey. <hi>I anſwer, As the Prieſt durſt ſhut up the Leper from the whole Congregation, becauſe of Gods ſpeciall command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> And with us, perſons are ſuſpended from the Lords Supper, as they were ſuſpended from the Paſſover, by Gods eſpeciall command, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21. May I forfeit a right to all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and may not I forfeit a right to one Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance? Was not the Inceſtuous Corinth a Profeſſor, even when excommunicated? That he was Baptized, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> will grant; that he was kept from Hearing, or any other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but actuall receiving, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> cannot prove. He was then a Profeſſor, even after excommunication, though not a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member till received again, upon teſtification of his repentance. If therefore profeſſion be enough for admiſſion, then, even perſons excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ought to be admitted to the Lords Supper. In perſons at age, profeſſion muſt precede Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip, and may continue, after a perſon is cut off from Church-memberſhip, unleſſe he openly renounce Chriſtianity, which, I believe, few excommunicated perſons do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>D. Dr.</hi> Did he never hear of reall and viſible worthineſſe? Mr. <hi>Humphrey. Page</hi> 104, and 105. <hi>I confeſſe I have heard of the viſible Church, Saints by calling, Profeſſors, &amp;c. But this viſible worthineſſe, as diſtinguiſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, I have not leightly read of, but in him;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:120105:104"/>
and look at his expreſſion and his meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as exotick to the Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſhew me the terme <hi>viſible</hi> (as applyed to the Church) in Scripture if he can; I am aſſured he cannot. 2<hi>ly.</hi> The thing of <hi>viſible worthineſſe,</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture warrants, as diſtinct from Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; for which, take theſe Texts, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 52. <hi>If he will ſhew himſelfe a worthy man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But, if wickedneſſe ſhall be found in him,</hi> &amp;c. Is not worthineſſe ſhewn, viſible worthineſſe? and <hi>contra,</hi> Is not wickedneſſe found in a man, viſible unworthineſſe? Again. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>Enquire who is worthy in a City.</hi> Surely, Chriſt ſets them not to enquire who had truth of grace, that were (as Mr. <hi>Humphre</hi> phraſes it) to pry into Gods ſecrets. Nor doth he bid them enquire barely, who were profeſſors, by Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, fince the whole City, or the greateſt part thereof, were ſuch, as being Jewes, to whom only the Apoſtles were ſent, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. <hi>verſe</hi> 5, 6. It muſt needs then be a worthineſſe of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Goſpell, and of ſuitable pious walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Apoſtles were to look after, and not to lodge in profane, but in religious families; which worthineſſe might be found out by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. And if this be not viſible worthineſſe, I pray what is? Once more, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5. The Elders of the Jewes teſtifie, the Centurion is <hi>worthy:</hi> Surely they were no merit-mongers, nor would Chriſt have acted upon ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: He had then a worthineſſe of meetneſſe, and this worthineſſe was viſible, by his love to Gods people, in building them a Synagogue. That this Centurion was Circumcized, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:120105:105"/>
or a Church-member, I think Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> will not aſſert; I am conſident, he cannot prove it. Yet, here is worthineſſe, and viſible worthineſſe, in one, that was neither Baptized, nor a Church-member. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10. 22. From all which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, by Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his leave, that viſible worthineſſe, as diſtinct from Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is not exotick to the Scripture.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of this Section, after ſome flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, at which he is excellent, I perceive, that my anatomizing of his Onyon (which I hoped might open his eyes, and make him weep) hath put him into an angry (I will not ſay, ſpitefull) diſtemper; I had rather ſuch words ſhould drop from Mr. Humphrey his pen, then from mine. And becauſe he cannot juſtly quarrell with my words, therefore he is pleaſed to put a ſenſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, <hi>As if I cenſured him, and all of his minde, to be oppoſers of the Church; and the wicked; and my party, only to be the godly,</hi> pag. 106.</p>
               <p>A ſad charge, and very uncharitable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference both to my words and meaning. My words are theſe, <hi>page</hi> 75. of my <hi>Bar:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">The beſt uſe therefore that can be made of his pield Onyon, is, to draw tears from his own, and others eyes; for thoſe extravagant diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his, whereby he hath as much as in him lies, troubled the Church, hindred reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtrengthened the hands of the wicked, and ſadned the hearts of the righteous, &amp;c.</q> Theſe are my words, and 1. Have I in them ſpoke any more, then the very truth? 2<hi>ly.</hi> Is here one word, charging him, and all that are of his
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:120105:105"/>
minde to be wicked. Thirdly, doth not this diſcourſe of M. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſadden the Godly, and make the wicked rejoyce? I uttered not theſe expreſſions by roat (as he is pleaſed to upbraid me) but deliberately, and with grief and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy. Fourthly, what is there of ſpight, or of the Spider ſucking poyſon, in thoſe expreſſions of mine? As for Antiquity, I wonder how in the ſame page Maſter <hi>Humphrey</hi> can pretend to it, which (if he know any thing of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity) he cannot be ignorant is againſt him. I ſee the man is galled, and cannot bear the gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Item of reproof, but preſently throws <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>ſpleen</hi> in the face of the reprover. Truely Sir, what I ſpake was not by roat, nor in paſſion. I am of the ſame mind ſtill, what ever bitter miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions you are pleaſed to make of thoſe words of mine. Indeed I looked at him, and all that vent themſelves for his looſe principles, as troublers (I did not ſay <hi>oppoſers,</hi> though even this word is not culpable, if rightly, and candidly underſtood) of the Church in that act; but I neither looked at all of his minde as ungodly, nor at all of our mindes as Godly. I am far from li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting piety to a party in his ſenſe, but deſire ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſit down and mourne, that Godly men are ſo acceſſary to, in the making, and abetting of parties, both againſt faith and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

And</hi> 1. <hi>he quotes Mr.</hi> Perkins, pag. 109. and 110.</p>

Secondly, that in order hereunto all muſt make conſcience to fit themſelves, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, <hi>page</hi> 110. Thirdly, that any ought to receive <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> when unprepared Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> cannot prove. Fourthly, that Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> is not of Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his minde herein, to me ſeems more than probable, becauſe in the third Propoſition cited by M. <hi>Humphrey</hi> he concludes, <hi>Every one is to receive according to the laudable cuſtom of his own Church;</hi> But it hath been, and ſtill is the laudable cuſtome of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to try perſons at age before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. We ſhall not deny the Sacrament to any that will receive it, according to the laudable cuſtome of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 110. Note. 1. If M.<hi>H.</hi> be Judge, his words are oracles, my anſwers are trifles. Secondly, Poor infants are a mighty rub in his way; they make him complain now the ninth time. God knows how to perfect praiſe out of the mouths of Babes and ſucklings. Thirdly, he frights me with two terrible Thorns, but tells me not what they are, haply to make them more formidable. I gueſſe they are the Thorns he put in the hand of infants and ideots; which upon tryal I have found to be but painted Thornes; but being turned upon himſelf, they prove real Thornes; No wonder the man complains more then ſeven times. Fourthly, he tells the Reader, <hi>I ſay, and ſay on.</hi> Haply the Reader might ſuſpect I ſaid nothing, unleſſe Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> had ſpoke out for me. I thank him he will honour me ſo far as to be my Cryer. Fifthly, he findes fault I am too fine, yet ſuſpects I am not in good earneſt. Truely Sir, I hope I affect not finery but ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. I part not thoſe actions Chriſt hath joyned, nor will joyn thoſe which Chriſt hath parted. As the Covenant, ſo the Seals are appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to all conditionally and mediately; but the Covenant is not abſolutely, and immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to any that are viſibly out of Covenant; and therefore by proportion, neither the Seales of the Covenant. The Covenant is conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and mediately, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15, 16. even to Heathen applicable, yet I hope M. <hi>Humphrey</hi> will not admit Heathen to the Sacrament: His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate will not help him as hath been formerly ſhewed. For 1. if ſuch a perſon muſt be ſuſpended before excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:120105:107"/>
then ſuſpenſion is a diſtinct ordinance from excommunication by Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his own grant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if Chriſts univerſal (do this) be limited by <hi>Pauls</hi> exception (put away from you ſuch a perſon) then its further evident that Chriſts commanding all Church members to receive is limited by <hi>Paul's</hi> exception, that a Brother, or Church member, if a raylor, a drunkard, unclean, covetuous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt not be admitted to the Lords Supper, as being <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate: and withall that any ſin in viſible Dominion makes a perſon <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate, as covetouſneſſe, railing, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though not capital; and then I pray why may not ignorance in dominion ſuſpend as well as ſcandal.</p>
               <p>His amplification from <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 23, 25. makes rather againſt than for him. Since its evident by that Text. Firſt, that moral pollution, as malice (till removed) ſuſpended a man from Sacrifice. Secondly, that moral (as well as Levitical) pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution may ſuſpend a man from inſtituted, but not from natural worſhip. Sacrifices and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are inſtituted worſhip, prayer, and hearing are natural worſhip. A <hi>Zimri</hi> is bound to hear &amp; pray, be he never ſo bad, not to ſo offer Sacrifice, or receive the Sacrament <hi>in ſtatu quo.</hi> The law of Creation bindes to natural worſhip, which no unworthineſſe of the Creature can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve. Hence the Lord diſpenſeth much in, and about inſtituted worſhip, not ſo in natural worſhip, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 22, 23. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:120105:107"/>Thirdly, what if the Sacrificer will never be reconciled, muſt he notwithſtanding be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to offer? Our Saviour ſayes he muſt firſt be reconciled &amp; then offer; <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, he muſt firſt be prepared and ſo eat; ſurely then he muſt not offer till reconciled, nor receive till prepared; And, if his malice and unpreparedneſſe be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, he may and muſt be ſuſpended. Fourthly, from Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his own grant, If <hi>there be many occaſions of forbearing a duty,</hi> and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſſe be a juſt occaſion and a grand occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; then, as this unpreparedneſſe ſhould oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion my forbearing; ſo, if viſible, it ſhould occaſion the Churches ſuſpending of me; and ſuch is viſible ignorance or prophaenneſs in any Church-member. If he may forbear upon juſt occaſion, why may not the Church or any particular member adviſe him to that which is lawfull; If he muſt forbear, why may not the Church, or any particular member adviſe him to his duty; and in caſe he will act againſt his duty, why may not the Church uſe her power to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend him from that unlawfull act? I make my ſelf no more Lord over Gods comand by telling my Brother this is not his duty, than by telling him, this is his duty. In both I make my ſelf Lord of Gods command if my advice be contrary to the affirmative and negative precept; in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if my advice be conſonant to the rule.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> pag. 112. <hi>To hold it is not a mans duty to receive while unregenrat; this reaches the</hi> ſemper <hi>&amp; looſes the bands of Gods commands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It reaches the <hi>ſemper</hi> onely conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as legal uncleanneſſe might haply reach the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:120105:108"/>
                  <hi>ſemper</hi> in order to the paſſe-over, and as excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication may reach the <hi>ſemper</hi> in caſe the perſon excommunicated continue obſtinate. Secondly, How doth it looſe the bands of Gods command, when Gods command is none ſhall receive till rightly prepared. If the truth of the promiſe offering Chriſt to all conditionally be not looſed though no unregenerate perſon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Chriſt, then the bands of the precept commanding all conditionally to receive are not looſed, though no unqualified perſon receive till Doomes day. The reaſon is clear, becauſe neither command nor promiſe are abſolute, but conditionall till the condition be performed. Thirdly, As to particular perſons, the command of ſuſpenſion is a ſpur to converſion and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal holineſſe; And ſince none continue in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency but by their own deſault, they may thanke themſelves who thereby make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of abſtention or detention perpetual. Fourthly, Yet by preſence at the Sacrament the Chriſt-murtherer may behold the Corps bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſee his own condemnation ſealed and both hear &amp; ſee Chriſt offered conditionally, though he neither receive nor touch the Sacramentall Elements. But to preſſe an impenitent and ſcandalous perſon to receive in order to the ſealing of his own condemnation as Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> aſſerts, <hi>pag.</hi> 113. to me ſeems a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth opinion and contradictory to Mr. <hi>Hums phrey</hi> his doctrine for ſuſpending of perſons <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate, who (upon ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) ought of all perſons to receive, in order to the ſealing of their own comdemnation, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:120105:108"/>
the more effectual promotion of their own converſion.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">Dr. <hi>Drake,</hi> an unregenerate man ſins in all his duties, yet he muſt do them; but there is not <hi>par ratio</hi> in order to a receiving. 1 Becauſe it is not his duty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> pag. 113. <hi>If receiving be not the duty of an unregenerate man, then muſt rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration be an eſſential antecedent to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; But ſo it is not: For</hi> 1. <hi>Then baptiſme was not adminiſtred validly to many by the Apoſtles,</hi> Acts 8. 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I might note the impropriety of that expreſſion <hi>eſſentially antecedent.</hi> Nothing is <hi>eſſentially antecedent</hi> to any thing, but it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive principles; and we do not make rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration a conſtitutive principle of receiving the Sacrament. Secondly, if by <hi>eſſential</hi> here he mean <hi>neceſſary,</hi> we grant regeneration a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary antecedent in order to the perſon recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and that by virtue of the precept; as purity was a neceſſary antecedent of receiving the Paſſe over. Thirdly, where as he infers, That then the baptiſme of many was not valid, I deny his conſequence, ſince in many things, <hi>Quod fieri non debuit factum valet.</hi> Secondly, becauſe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the perſon to be baptiſed, being unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ought not to offer himſelf to baptiſme, yet this reaches not the Miniſter that is to baptize him, unleſſe his unregeneration be viſible. I may not offer my ſelf to partake if unregenerate; but the Miniſter may admit me coming, if he have charitative grounds to judge me regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. The ſame anſwer will ſatisfie his ſecond
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:120105:109"/>
objection, for baptiſme is valid where there is no eſſential faylure; if the perſon baptized be a viſible Saint, the perſon baptiſing be authorized by Chriſt, and the Element be rightly applied according to Chriſts inſtitution; in a word, if Chriſts form of baptiſme be obſerved <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 19. but this may be done to a perſon unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare, and is valid being done, though the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumenus</hi> ſin in offering himſelf, if unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; but need not be baptiſed again when once regenerate.<note place="margin">Acts 8. 37.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It will alſo ſatisfie his third objection: A Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may in faith adminiſter, either of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments to others beſides himſelf, ſince the rule he is to proceed by is not holineſſe as real, but as viſible; &amp; where he hath a charitative ground to judge any to be regenerate, he both may and ought to baptiſe ſuch a perſon, in caſe he offer himſelf to be baptiſed regularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For his fifth objection, that then no doubting Chriſtian can himſelf receive, for he cannot act in faith ſo long as he is not fully perſwaded of his own regeneration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It's a fallacy to argue from the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of regeneration to the neceſſity of the clear &amp; full evidence of regeneration. He that hath truth of grace, ſins neither materially nor formally in receiving; provided he be not wanting to himſelf in due examination and preparation. Secondly, if a doubting Chriſtian cannot act in faith, then no man in the world can act in faith, ſince the beſt of Saints are more, or leſſe peſtred with doubting, and that both in the faith of aſſent, of adherence and of evidence. Thirdly, he may as well doubt whither he ſin in abſtaining as in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:120105:109"/>
receiving, ſince ſome comfortable hopes of grace incourage him to receive, as ſome dark fears on the other hand diſcourage him. Fourthly, if evidences for grace be praedominant, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary fears ſhould not diſcourage him. Fifthly, if hopes be ballanced with equal fears, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballanced with Symptomes of unregeneracy, his ſureſt way is to apply himſelf to ſome faithfull and experienced friend, or Miniſter, upon whoſe advice he may comfortably approach, or forbear the Sacrament for that time. Yea, this advice is very ſafe and uſefull, where any one doubt about my ſpiritual Eſtate ariſeth, which by a diligent ſelf-ſcrutiny cannot be reſolved; It being dangerous in point of doubts (as well as in other caſes) to keep the Devils counſel. For a brief, yet full reſolution of the caſe about perſons to be ſuſpended, I referre the Reader to the larger Cathechiſme of the Aſſembly of Divines, where they handle the Doctrine of the Lords Supper: where alſo they do poſitively affirm, <hi>That ſuch as are found to be ignorant and ſcandalous, notwithſtanding their profeſſions of the faith, and deſire to come to the Lords Supper, may, and ought to be kept from that Sacrament by the power which Chriſt hath left in his Church, untill they receive inſtruction and manifeſt their reformation.</hi> I hope its no preſumption to ſay, That ſuch a Teſtimony for ſuſpenſion from ſo many Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, Learned, and pious Divines will ballance, if not preponderate the oppoſite Teſtimonies produced by Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> were they as full to his purpoſe as his heart could deſire. But I truſt to make it appear (which in part is done already)
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:120105:110"/>
that thoſe eminent perſons by him quoted are rather friends to our ſuſpenſion than to his free Admiſſion.</p>
               <p>If yet it be objected; I, but will not this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of doubting Chriſtians admiſſion to the Sacrament, be a precipice to unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who upon ſleight and trivial evidences will conclude themſelves in the ſtate of grace, and ſo ruſh upon the Sacrament unworthily?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Its no more a precipice to them than all other parts of the Goſpel are: Offer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Hypocrites are forwardeſt to catch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly at them; thunder out threatnings, Hypocrites will put them off with a wet finger; binde them with precepts, Hypocrites have an helliſh art to cut, or break this Gordian knot which they cannot untye fairly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is a precipice not of Gods, but of their own, and the Devils making, who are willingly thereby deceived, and ſo catch both at promiſes and Sacraments, writing and feal, to their own deſtruction. To prevent which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief (as much as lies in man) cautions are an uſefull boundary in order to the promiſes, and ſuſpenſion in order to the Sacrament; which though it cannot keep away all Hypocrites, yet it ſerves to uncaſe divers, and to make all Church-members ſtudious of competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and outward reformation, a bleſſing highly to be prized in every reformed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Church.</p>

Secondly, though ſome ſeparated aſſemblies own divers of our Congregations as true Churches, yet will they not admit divers (not onely of our Church-members, but alſo) of our Communicants, upon this very account, becauſe they apprehend them not ſo viſibly worthy; An apparent Teſtimony to me, that they with us meaſure the ſubject of Sacramental Admiſſion, rather by viſibility than by Church-memberſhip. Eſpecially, conſidering withall, that one main ground of their firſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from us was offence taken at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Admiſſion of Church-members to the Lords Supper: Upon which account thoſe who feared God among the Presbyterians were the more zealous for Sacramental tryal, that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in this particular they might prevent

               <p>The next queſtion in debate is, how we can baptiſe the Children of Church members, &amp; at the ſame time turn away their parents from the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper?</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> pag. 117. I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe what Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> hath ſaid pag. 82, 83, 84. I wiſh it may be maintained. But as for thoſe who never tooke notice, or not approved of any other ground of their baptiſme, but as they are immediately born Chriſtians of ſuch as viſibly profeſſe Chriſt according to my terms the right which the Parents derive upon their Children unto baptiſme muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be in themſelves unto the Sacrament, unleſſe there be a manifeſt impediment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench that right, or the preſent injoyment of it by excommunication, diſtraction or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Drake. Anſ.</hi> 1. He granting my conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the Children of all Church-members
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:120105:111"/>
(be they ſuſpended or not) may be baptiſed, his exeption is impertinent as to us, who hold and approve other grounds of admitting Children to baptiſme than the right they have to it by their immediate Parents either as Profeſſours or as Church-members: Nay, were both the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Parents excommunicated we ſhall not refuſe to baptiſe their Children, provided any perſon of truſt will undertake for their educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Chriſtian faith into which they are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſed. The right a Childe hath to baptiſme by his immediate Parents is a good right, but not the ſole right. See more in my barrel, <hi>pag.</hi> 81. 87.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſhould I retort the queſtion upon Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> how can he allow baptiſing the Children of divers Church members, and yet diſcourage thoſe very Church-members from the Sacrament? He that diſcourages from the means diſcourages from the end, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> diſcourages from Sacramental trial, the means, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Here indeed we come to the very hinge of the controverſy which Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> pag. 117. and 118. ſtates bewtixt us thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> the ſubſtance of the whole comes unto thus, that the Parents muſt have a further right to ſhew than what they have common with their Childe to this ordinance. And here indeed lies the very point of our difference: I hold it is Church-memberſhip (where there is none of our former yielded impediments) that gives an immediate out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward right to the Sacrament. He holds a man muſt be firſt tried if he be viſibly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:120105:112"/>
and it is that alone can give him admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In my Barre, <hi>pag.</hi> 81. I proved, that Church-memberſhip is not the adequate foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of receiving, becauſe the all Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould be admitted to the Lords ſupper: But all Church-members ought not to be admitted, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> himſelf being Judge, to wit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants &amp; Idiots; to which I may now add out of Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> perſons <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, all which he grants to be Church-members, yet is pleaſed to ſuſpend them from the Lords ſupper. If the Lord hath excluded them let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſhew the Decree of Heaven by ſome expreſſe place of Scripture. Where hath God ſaid in termes, Infants, Idiots and perſons <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate ſhall not receive. If it be, becauſe they cannot prepare themſelves right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor diſcern the Lords body, no more can ignorant, and ſcandalous perſons <hi>in ſtatu quo:</hi> therefore ſay we, either exclude all or none. If he ſay, the inability of Infants and Idiots is natural, but that of intelligent Church-members is moral.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Natural inability doth not exclude from all ordinances, inſtance in Circumciſion then, baptiſme now, the word preached, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, that natural inability excludes from the Lords Supper is more than Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> can prove, unleſſe he make it out by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Thirdly, the inabiliby of perſons <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate is moral, yet their ſuſpenſion Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> allowes; and why not the ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of other intelligent Church-members alſo,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:120105:112"/>
who are morally unable as well as they. If yet he ſay, Perſons <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate are ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to avoid ſcandal, upon the very ſame account ſay we, muſt ignorant and ſcandalous perſons be ſuſpended. <hi>Object.</hi> Perſons <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate are ſuſpended in order to excommunication. <hi>Anſ.</hi> So may ignorant and ſcandalous perſons be alſo, if they ſhall wilfully perſiſt in groſſe ignorance, or ſcandal, though of an inferiour allay; yet we had rather uſe ſuſpenſion to prevent, than to prepare for excommunication. The iſſue of all is this: That either Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> muſt ſhew expreſſe Scripture for his Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or elſe admit our Limitations alſo, which have as good vvarrant from Scripture as his: were I of Maſter <hi>Humphrey</hi> his minde, that Church-member-ſhip gives an immediate right to the Lords Supper (ſee <hi>pag.</hi> 118. of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder) I ſhould rather undertake to maintain the Admiſſion of Infants, Idiots; yea, perſons <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate, and with more probability of argument, than he doth his free Admiſſion, which yet excludes a great part, if not the greater part of Church-members. If he be for free Admiſſion, why doth he limit it; if he will needs limit it, how is it free; yea, why doth he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us for that of which himſelf is guilty, if it be an errour? We grant, all Church members ought to receive, if there be no impediment, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, or moral; this Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> grants alſo, yet in one and the ſame breath as it were blames us, for doing that which himſelf allows; you ſee how the ſtating of the queſtion for himſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws his concluſion for free Admiſſion. Now
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:120105:113"/>
let us ſee how he ſtates it for us, in the latter branch.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 118. of his Rejoynder Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> holds a man muſt firſt be tried, if he be viſibly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; and it is that alone can give him Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We hold: 1. That it's the duty of every Chriſtian, or Church-member, to be willing, and ready to be tried by any, upon juſt occaſion; yea, though it may prove prejudicial to their outward man, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Be ready alwayes to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you.</hi> Secondly, That they are more bound to ſubmit to tryal by thoſe, who are over them in the Lord, who muſt give, and therefore take an account of their Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. Such are Superiours in Family, Church, and State. 3<hi>ly.</hi> The Time, Frequency and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of tryal, as to Perſons, Method, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as in ſundry other parts of vvorſhip) is not expreſly determinded in Scripture, no more than how often the Sacrament ſhall be received; but is leſt to Chriſtian prudence. Fourthly, That as this tryal doth, eſpecially reſpect the Sacrament an Univerſal, Spiritual, and effectual Ordinance, containing the Letter and Spirit of all other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, ſo the fitteſt time for this trial in Chriſtian prudence is judged (by wiſer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perſons than Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> and my ſelf) to be before the Sacrament, or between the paſt and ſucceeding Sacrament; which as an help to ſelf-examination may very much through grace promote our Sacramentall prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:120105:113"/>Theſe things premiſed, we ſay: 1. That every Church-member is bound to ſubmit to Church-tryal, by virtue of the fifth Commandment; by virtue of the general precept aforementioned, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. and by virtue of that principle of ſpiritual ſelf-love, which either is, or ſhould be in him. Secondly, That real worthineſſe gives a perſon a right before God to either of the Sacraments, and that abſtractedly from Church-member-ſhip, or Church-tryal; upon which account he may deſire and demand them, or either of them as his due orderly; firſt baptiſme, and afterwards the Lords Supper: there being in a right ſenſe (as Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> notes) <hi>par ratio utriuſque Sacramenti.</hi> That intelligent perſon whom I will admit to baptiſme, I will alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Lords Supper, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 36, 37. <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy heart, thou mayeſt.</hi> Believing with all the heart (which is real worthineſſe) gave the Eunuch a right to baptiſme; who yet thereby was not admitted a Member of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation, (as Children, or grown perſons are with us) and whither be joyned himſelf to any, or no, is queſtionable. Thirdly, That viſible worthineſſe is neceſſary as the fruit and ſigne of real worthineſſe; juſt as profeſſion and confeſſion is a neceſſary companion, or conſequent of faith and grace within, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. both being in effect one and the ſame thing. Such was the Eunuch's deportment and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his faith before <hi>Philip</hi> baptiſed him. It's agreed on all hands, that no perſon really (that is habitually and actually) worthy muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Sacrament; as all Jews, if clean, were to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:120105:114"/>
eat the Paſſeover. The queſtion is how the Prieſts then, and how Church-Officers now ſhould put a difference between clean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, between worthy and unworthy: That both were to do it doctrinally is agreed: That both were to do it practically is evident by the rule, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. Secondly, by practice approved in Scripture, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 23. 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 26, 27. and by theirs, and our Church-Diſcipline, together with their leſſer degrees of excommunication, anſwering ours of ſuſpenſion; Demonſtrative proofs of cleanneſſe and worthineſſe, were, and are very difficult (if not impoſſible) to them and us. As therefore they did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 4, 5. ſo muſt we reſt in topical and probable evidences; ſuch are with us competent knowledge, verbal and real profeſſion confirmed by our own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, or by ſufficient Teſtimony. Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably, groſſe ignorance, or ſcandal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by due tryal, obſervation, or Teſtimony, as above, are topical arguments of real unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in our Saviours judgement amount to knowledge, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 26. Church-Officers then muſt put a difference, not onely Doctrinally, but alſo practically between clean and unclean, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and unworthy, denying thoſe priviledges at preſent, to perſons viſibly unclean and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, which otherwiſe were their due to injoy. An Executor, or Adminiſtrator is not bound im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon demand to give Legacies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to any Legatee, till he have at leaſt probable evidence that the party demanding is a Legatee, and qualified according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions annexed to the Legacy by the will of the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:120105:114"/>
Teſtator. In like manner Church-Officers, who are Chriſts Adminiſtrators, and Over-ſeers muſt not look at every one as a Legatee, who ſayes he is ſo, yea, though he be a Member of the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; nor can look at thoſe, who are groſly ignorant, or ſcandalous as Legatees <hi>in ſtatu quo,</hi> ſince they can neither examine themſelves, nor diſcern the Lords body in the Apoſtles ſenſe. Let the Reader here take notice. 1. That we hold not that tryal is <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſſary for every Church-member: where perſons are well known to be men of knowledge and piety, there tryal is requiſite onely in a prudential way, leaſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected perſons ſhould preſume, upon their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in this manner, to challenge the like favour. The end of Trial being diſcovery, what need we try that which is well known? Onely ſuch do well to ſubmit to tryal (among other grounds) for good examples ſake, &amp; to prevent exceptions that otherwiſe will be taken. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That we hold not that tryal gives admiſſion (it being indifferent to Admiſſion, or Suſpenſion) but diſcovery of Sacramental wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe in order to Receiving, to which he had a right by real worthineſſe: As diſcovery by tryal, or otherwiſe gives a Legatee, the injoyment of that Legacy to which he had a right by the will of the Teſtator. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> therefore is not ſo accurate in the ſtating of our opinion as he would make the vvorld believe: Since. 1. Our rule of trying, who are worthy is not (in our judgement) univerſally obligatory, but may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a diſpenſation. Secondly, Becauſe we hold not that tryal alone can give a Church-member
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:120105:115"/>
Admiſſion to the Lords Supper, but approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon tryal, or otherwiſe. All which laid together, diſcovers the vanity of his inſulting in the following words, <hi>pag.</hi> 118. <hi>For the one now, look over Mr.</hi> Drake, <hi>and you ſhall finde ſtill whenſoever he falls upon this thing, he has nothing againſt it, but that ſilly reaſon (from the unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent) ſo often repeated. Had he any thing elſe would it not be alleadged? and has he nothing elſe and will now be captivated? For the other, look over the Scripture, and ſee if he can produce you any precept of God for it. If he has none, will his own word go? while he has ſo little againſt us, and no Text for himſelf, his skirts are diſcovered and heels made bare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> is no Oracle; nor is a reaſon ſilly, becauſe he ſayes ſo; nor is that reaſon (from the unintelligent) ſilly (however he looking through the Spectacles of prejudice apprehend it ſo) as hath been elſe where proved. Secondly, Is nothing alleadged to confute his free Admiſſion, but the reaſon drawn from the unintelligent? Let the Reader peruſe my Barre from <hi>pag.</hi> 81. to 87. (beſides other places) &amp; then judge how much Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his paſſionate aſſertions are to be credited? Thirdly, Will he have us produce Scripture to prove his fancies? We hold not its tryal alone will give Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will he blame us for not proving that which we hold not? Fourthly, It hath been proved. Firſt, That unworthy Church-members (though intelligent) ought hot to receive. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That all muſt ſubmit to tryal upon juſt occaſion. Thirdly, That they who upon tryal
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:120105:115"/>
are found unworthy are to be ſuſpended. Fourthly, We believe that they who refuſe tryal without any ſufficient ground given for that their refuſal, ought alſo to be ſuſpended. Our reaſon is, becauſe by ſuch an Act they appear to Church-Officers as ſinners againſt light, which makes a perſon as to them actually unworthy, how ever he, or ſhe may be habitually worthy. Fifthly, We can produce as good Scripture for our Limitation, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey</hi> can for his Limitation. Here may I not ſpeak to the Reader in M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his own words by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſion? Look over all the Scripture, and ſee if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey</hi> can produce you any precept of God for ſuſpending the unintelligent, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate (underſtand me of expreſſe Texts, for if he fly to conſequences, let him not blame us for uſing the ſame <hi>mediums,</hi> which we judge valid as well as an expreſſe Text) if he has none, will his own word go, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> page 119. <hi>I do willingly yield to all our known bars (under the unintelligent and excommunicate) the Church has allowed; but am fully perſwaded that this Bar, Mr.</hi> Drake <hi>would not ſet up otherwiſe, has no foundation in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his preſwaſion is no Demonſtration; or if it were, certainly in all equity, the ſame priviledge ſhould be granted to our perſwaſion: what follows thence but an abſurdity and impoſſibility, that there are, or may be two contrary Demonſtrations in order to that which is every way one and the ſame, as if there could be one Demonſtration to prove
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:120105:116"/>
Sun hath light, and another Demonſtration to prove the Sun hath not light.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>He yields to all our known bars,</hi> &amp;c. Why ſo? 1. <hi>Becauſe the Church allowes them:</hi> And hath not the Church, both in former ages, and doth it not in this age allow alſo the Bar of of viſible unworthineſſe. Secondly, Becauſe his allowed Bars have a foundation in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>not to my Bar</hi> as he is pleaſed to phraſe it.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſame, or like foundation, that his Bars have, our Bars have; his Bars are founded, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon inability to examine ownes ſelf, as in the unintellent, or in viſible unworthineſſe, as in perſons <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate; our Bar hath the ſame foundation, to wit, 1. Inability to examine ownes ſelf, 2<hi>ly.</hi>ſcandallous living.</p>
               <p>Here, to Evade, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> is fine, and ſubtil, <hi>pag.</hi> 120. making a diſtinction where God makes none. He diſtinguiſheth between unintelligent perſons that are bound to get knowledge, and unintelligent perſons that are not bound to get knowledge; and then tells us the former may be ſuſpended, the latter not. A ſtout affirmation, but where is his proof, or Demonſtration? Where hath God ſaid, that perſons naturally unintelligent ſhall be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended, but perſons morally unintelligent ſhall not be ſuſpended? Let him produce a Text of Scripture for it, if he can; if he cannot, will you believe Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> upon his bare word? We eaſily grant its the duty of all viſibly unworthy to get knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not ſo of Children and fools: but doth it follow thence, that the former, though groſly ignorant, muſt be admitted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:120105:116"/>
its their duty to get knowledge, the latter muſt be ſuſpended, becauſe its not their duty to get knowledge. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is the precept of actual examination, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. in order to receiving. Infants do not, cannot examine themſelves, and therefore muſt be kept away ſayes M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey.</hi> On the other hand: 1. Ignorant perſons do not, cannot examine themſelves, and therefore muſt be kept away, ſay we. Here to evade, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> tells, us, the former are not bound to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and therefore muſt be ſuſpended, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are bound to examine themſelves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt not be ſuſpended. Here we call for a proof, and for lack of a better muſt accept of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his aſſertion, a ſufficient proof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to fancy &amp; affection; but if weighed in the ballance of Scripture and ſolid reaſon, it will be found lighter than vanity. If actual examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be required, as is evident by the words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo let him eat,</hi> &amp;c. then defect of actual examination is an Apoſtolick Bar. This is Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his foundation to exclude Children. Examination is required, Children cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this duty, therefore they muſt be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We infer, ignorant perſons cannot examine themſelves, therefore they alſo muſt be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There's not one tittle in this Text, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to exclude thoſe who are naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and to admit thoſe who are morally una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Nay, if any, the latter are rather to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded than the former: we believe that both are to be excluded, the former as negatively, the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:120105:117"/>
as privatively unworthy: And for further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation dare appeal to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> if he will be true to himſelf. <hi>He grants that intelligent Church-members, if</hi> jure <hi>excommunicate may be ſuſpended.</hi> This we grant alſo: Onely the ground of his grant, if ſolid, is the ſame with ours, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>by ſhame to bring the perſon ſuſpended to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to ſatisfie the godly, and to be a good example unto others.</hi> See <hi>pag.</hi> 22. of his rejoynder. Theſe are ſome, though not all of our grounds for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpending the ignorant and ſcandalous. Will M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey</hi> allow theſe grounds of ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ſome intelligent Church-members, and not for all. If this be not ſtrange partiallity, I pray what is?</p>
               <p>As for what he adds, <hi>pag.</hi> 120. <hi>As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants and the diſtracted, we know ſignes cannot have any real work on them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What if they cannot, is this a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to deny them the ſignes, then let Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> turn Antipaedobaptiſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though the ſigne cannot work, cannot God work by the ſigne as an inſtituted antecedent, or concomitant of Divine operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Otherwiſe Children are baptized in vain. There is <hi>better</hi> ground for applying ſignes to perſons naturally unintelligent, than to perſons morally unintelligent. I can baptiſe a Childe that is naturally unintelligent, not ſo a perſon at years of diſcretion, who is morally unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: And if there be <hi>par ratio utriuſque Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti;</hi> then he, who is not to be baptiſed (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his groſſe ignorance) at years of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were here then unbaptiſed, ought upon the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:120105:117"/>
ſame account to be denied the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, though formerly baptiſed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Humphrey, <hi>If I ſhould do the Church ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice In ſubmitting to this way onely as humane, then I ſhall do God ſervice, to oppoſe it as divine, and not let it ſit in his Seat, as a neceſſary antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Where an humane order is preſt as a divine ordinance, I may and ought ſo far forth to oppoſe it, and ſhall do God good ſervice therein, ſo my oppoſition be regular. Yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, at the ſame time in ſome caſes I may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit practically to the ſame, provided it be in it's own nature indifferent, eſpecially upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of my diſſent from it as a divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; thus <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſed, yet practited, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion upon occaſion, which then was no divine ordinance, yet was by the Jewes preſt as a divine ordinance; compare, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 3. and 5. 2, 3. With <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 3. Had Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> perſwaded people to ſubmit to trial, though not as a divine ordinance, he might have done both God and the Church more ſervice than now he doth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral judgements may unite in the ſame pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice upon ſeveral principles without prejudice to Gods worſhip or the breach of faith and love. I both wiſh and hope. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> may be of this minde, we deſire unity of practice and ſhall pray for unity of principles, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To ſubmit to trial, or <hi>to be ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to give an anſwer to every man that asks us a reaſon of the hope that is in us is</hi> (in a large ſenſe as a thing commanded) a divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; the timing of this trial is humane and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:120105:118"/>
prudential, in which I hope we may adhere to the judgement of a Parliament and Aſſembly of Learned and pious Divines, rather than to the judgement of any private Chriſtian or Miniſter. Hearing and receiving are divine ordinances; hearing at ten in the morning, &amp; receiving every firſt Lords day in the month, are humane orders and prudential; yet they who will not hear and receive at times particularly appointed by man, may haply go without word and Sacrament all their dayes, and are guilty of excommunicating and ſuſpending themſelves. Will any be ſo fond hence to conclude that either the State, Church or Miniſter hold the timing of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be a divine ordinance, or a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concomitant to the Lords Supper by way of ſpecial inſtitution? In like manner, that all ſhould ſubmit to trial is a divine ordinance or precept; but that they ſhould be tried before or after a Sacrament, and often or ſeldom, or but once in all their life, is humane and prudential; and no more a neceſſary <hi>Antecedent</hi> of receiving than the timing of the Lords Supper is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary concomitant of receiving; yet as he who will not come to receive at the time ordered ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpends himſelf from the Sacramant; ſo he that will not ſubmit to the time appointed for trial is a ſelf ſuſpender. Submiſſion to trial is a duty, the ſeaſon of this trial is indifferent; and being agreed upon by a common order or conſent ought not to be ſleighted or oppoſed by any private Chriſtian or Miniſter. Let the trial be when it will, it muſt be either before or after the Sacrament. And if the terme <hi>Antecedent</hi> be
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:120105:118"/>
offenſive, we ſhall onely deſire the people to ſubmit to a <hi>conſequent</hi> trial. <hi>Pag.</hi> 121. Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> is pleaſed to cloſe this ſection merrily with a Jury of 12. I envy not his mirth, but wiſh it may do himſelf and his reader much good. If it hurt not himſelf more than me, he will have no great cauſe to repent of it.</p>

Thirdly, Though haply a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter have no power of himſelf to ſuſpend any or turn him away, yet he may have power over his own act; and forbear giving the Sacrament to a viſibly unworthy perſon, and withall may round him in the ear (if occaſion ſerve) and bid him beware leaſt taking the Sacrament unworthily, he do eat and drinke judgement to himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. For that promiſe <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 4. The thing promiſed here is life; this life is initiall or graduall: That life initall, or the firſt infuſion of ſaving is grace premiſed to every ordinance, as it is to the word preached, doth not appear by this place; and were it true, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> doth
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:120105:120"/>
ill to allow the ſuſpenſion or excommunication of any from any ordinance: The Lord forbid we ſhould deny the means of initiall conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to any without expreſſe warrant from Heaven: therefore we pray for all, that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance being a means of converſion by way of impetration, be the perſons prayed for preſent or no. Therefore we preach to all, the word being an inſtrument of converſion, an immortal ſeed, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 17. 30. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. v. 14, 17. and 1 <hi>Petr.</hi> 1. v. 23, 24. But where is the Sacrament ſo ſtiled? The Sacraments ſuppoſe, but do not worke converſion. For the other branch of the text, namely the condition or precept of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God. That every one is bound to uſe every ordinance in order to the ſeeking of God thereby for imitiall converſion is not proved by that place, which onely requires the ſeeking of God in generall, but layes no command upon every perſon to partake of every ordinance, but onely to ſeek God in thoſe ordinances he is capable of: we muſt here again diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween natural and inſtituted worſhip; Thoſe ordinances which are parts of natural worſhip lie upon all, and are beneficial to many in order to converſion, not ſo thoſe ordinances which are parts of inſtituted worſhip. This is evident in hearing, prayer, Sacrifices and Sacraments, the two former being incumbent upon all at years of diſcretion, not ſo the two latter. All are bound to ſeek God in all eſtates, as well as in all ordinances, but all I hope are not therefore to get into all eſtates or to partake of all ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Inſtance, I am bound to ſeek God in the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:120105:120"/>
Miniſtry, or in a married condition, if I be in either of theſe eſtates, but I hope every man is not therefore bound to be a Miniſter or to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In like manner, I am bound to ſeek God in all ordinances, if or when I do partake of all, but it followes not thence that I am bound to partake of all ordinances, no more than I am bound to marry or to be a Miniſter; but if I be in either of theſe eſtates I am bound to ſeek God in them. Here that precept or permiſſion of our Saviour is pertinent though with a little variation of his ſcope. Math. 19. 12. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

I muſt ſeek God by partaking of all Ordinances that I am capable of. Secondly, My great deſigne muſt be to ſeek God in all thoſe Ordinances I do actually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of: But it follows not thence that I muſt partake of every Ordinance whither I be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, or no. Yea, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate proves that all Church-members are not capable of all Church-Ordinances. This is (among others) the exception we make to his alleadging the general promiſes; and which Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> muſt own, or contradict both the truth and himſelf. His whole ſide of Rhetorick following (at which I muſt confeſſe he is good) will not help him where Logick and Divinity fail him. Therefore I let thoſe flouriſhes paſſe.</p>

If he ſay, he doth not think himſelf bound to this, let him take heed he be not miſtaken, ſince ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake (eſpecially if avowed) may prove very dangerous, both to himſelf and to his people.

that all may come prepared. But to ſay, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour my utmoſt <hi>de jure,</hi> is (in my poor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion) to ſay I indeavour as much as Gods command in its rigour requires of me; which expreſſion ſeems to me very haughty and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, though it fell from the mouth of a <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Timothy.</hi> Doth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey</hi> know (or the learnedſt Clerk in the vvorld) the utmoſt bounds of any command <hi>de jure,</hi> I mean as to the matter required in it, beſides the degree and circumſtances injoyned?

Is Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> guilty of omitting no endeavour? Or are not endeavours actions as well, though not as much, as compleat Acts? He wrongs me in reporting, <hi>pag.</hi> 125. That I ſay, <q rend="inline">that all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter can do (where there is no Presbytery) is exhortation and warning.</q> I believe, a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unpresbyterated, ought to try his people himſelf, and where he findes any ignorant, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, or wilfull refuſers, he may ſuſpend his own act of giving ſuch the Sacrament, though he cannot ſuſpend them juridically. I believe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That every Miniſter ought to endeavour much more then he knows, and therefore by conſequence much more then he doth actually endeavour. Indeed, <hi>pag.</hi> 47. of my Bar I ſay, <q rend="inline">That I humbly conceive, that where no Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That he cannot juridically, either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or ſuſpend ſuch a perſon;</q> and I hope I am not miſtaken in holding, That no Miniſter unpresbyterated can admit, or ſuſpend any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon juridically. But I never ſaid, That ſuch a Miniſter might not ſuſpend his own Act of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament to ſuch a perſon; which elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where I call Paſtoral ſuſpenſion. This I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to add, becauſe I perceive Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> is ſo prone to miſtake, both me and himſelf: and that through Gods aſſiſtance I might be a poor inſtrument to diſcover to him more pride in theſe expreſſions then haply he was aware of. If this be malicious reviling, the Lord ſend me ſtore of ſuch malicious Revilers.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Mr. <hi>Humphrey, pag.</hi> 126. I humbly <q rend="inline">confeſſe all our ſins, deſiring true repentance, and a pardon for all our Omiſſions.

I beſeech you, Sir, as you love your own Soul, take heed of pleading innocency where conſcience cannot but cry guilty: We acknowledge your charge, That when we have done all we can, we are but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants; yea, though we had done (which is impoſſible in <hi>ſtatu quo</hi>) the uttermoſt <hi>de jure,</hi> both as to endeavour &amp; compleat Act. But is not he unprofitable alſo (if not much more) who ſayes he hath endeavoured <hi>all,</hi> or his utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>de jure,</hi> and yet at the ſame time falls ſhort of endeavouring that which they perform <hi>de facto,</hi> who confeſſe they fall ſhort even of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring in any one particular of all their lives, their utmoſt <hi>de jure?</hi> Are not righteous endeavours part of righteouſneſſe, and doth not the Prophet expreſly ſay, <hi>Iſai</hi> 64. 6. That our righteouſneſſe; yea, our righteouſneſſes; yea, <hi>all our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags;</hi> and can Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſay he hath endeavoured his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>de jure</hi> in any one particular? If ſo, then
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:120105:123"/>
that endeavour is perfect, and ſo not an unclean rag: and Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> can bring ſomewhat that is perfectly clean (namely an endeavour that is perfect <hi>de jure</hi>) out of that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, an extraction, I believe, too high for any mortal. Sure I am, <hi>Job</hi> was of another minde, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 4. and the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21. Doth not ſin dwelling in me, oppoſe and refract my pious endeavours as well as my compleat actions? then ſin hinders in every thing, (not as to the doing of my endeavour in ſincerity, but) evermore as to the doing of my utmoſt endeavour <hi>de jure.</hi> I ſhall cloſe with this friendly Item, That Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> will gain neither comfort nor honour, either with God, or man, in perſiſting to avow, that he endeavours his utmoſt <hi>de jure</hi> in any one particular. He may fancie what he pleaſe of me; but, if I know my own heart, it is not malice, but love to his Soul makes me herin ſo plain with him. To what he adds, <hi>pag.</hi> 127. by way of vindication, I anſwer briefly. 1. There is no neceſſity to admit all. Secondly, There are other wayes to do them good by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides receiving. Thirdly, Hope depends upon faith, and faith upon a promiſe of doing good. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, He that eats and drinks unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, eats and drinks judgement to himſelf, Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> hopes the contrary. Whom ſhall we believe, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Humphrey?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the cloſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 128. He reflects upon me as boaſting, becauſe I ſay of the Godly Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians (of which number I hope I am, though moſt unworthy) <q rend="inline">That they go beyond him in their care and endeavour to fit all ſorts for
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:120105:124"/>
the Sacrament.</q> And to make this expreſſion the more odious. 1. He brings me in (againſt the very Letter of my Text) ſpeaking ſo of my ſelf in the firſt perſon ſingular. Secondly, As ſaying, that I far exceed him in fitting all ſorts for the Sacrament. Whereas 1. I expreſſe it in the firſt perſon plural. 2. Say that we go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond him in our actual care and indeavour to fit all ſorts. Is there no difference between fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all ſorts and endeavour to fit them? Yet withall I add. 1. That we fall exceeding ſhort in the very point of endeavour <hi>de jure.</hi> I hope my Preesbyterian brethren will not think I lay vile expreſſions upon them in ſo ſaying, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Mr. Humphrey</hi> charge me ſo for averring, and proving that he hath not endeavoured his utmoſt <hi>de jure</hi> to prepare his people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Did we indeed urge you to acknowledge, that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Governement is of divine right, or 2. That trial before the Presbyterie is built upon <hi>jus divinum,</hi> or elſe would not admit you; then might you well complain we lay ſnares for your conſciences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We indeed profeſſe our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for both in the affirmative; but we binde not any perſon under trial to be of our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein. Yea, before trial (if he pleaſe) let him profeſſe his judgement in the negative; that ſhall be no bar to our admitting him, provided
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:120105:124"/>
be not ignorant or ſcandalous. Nor ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of aſſent with us about the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of Presbyterian Governement and Sacramental tryal open the door for any, that upon tryal or otherwiſe are found ignorant or ſcandalous.

But I pray, Sir, Had Chriſt intended (as you pretend) to make this firſt adminiſtration a preſident for univerſall receiving, had it not bin eaſy for him to have commanded all his Diſciples (whithet ſincere or hypocriticall) either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with himſelf or in their particular meetings and families, as himſelf, did immediatly after the Paſſe-over? This Chriſt did not: nay he did not ſo much as invite thoſe Jewes who were in the houſe to receive with him, who yet were
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:120105:125"/>
Church-members as well as the Apoſtles. Hence we conclude; that Chriſts commanding his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to receive is no warrant for all Diſciples to receive pel-mell. He that commanded them before hand to meet him at Galilee, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 32. compare <hi>Math.</hi> 28. 7.10. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 6. could have commanded them before hand to celebrate this Sacrament immediately after the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, had he pleaſed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Here M. <hi>Humphrey</hi> failes a little in his Logicke, miſtaking an anſwer for an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> himſelf argued affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively from mans benefit to his duty, thus, the Sacrament is a means of converſion, ergo, The unregenerate muſt receive. I deny the minor, which being not proved by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey</hi> the concluſion falls as to that bottom. Who ſees not that here I am not the opponent but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent, and that it lies upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey</hi> to prove the Sacrament (as to it's receiving, for otherwiſe we hinde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That the Apoſtle reproved their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiving is evident: that he allowed none to look on but receivets, or any to receive but perſons Evangelically worthy is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; the verſe <hi>quoted proves</hi> no ſuch matter, but ſhewes that when perſons come to eat they muſt obſerve order. Is it probable the Apoſtle ſhould condemne receiving unworthily and yet allow receiving though unworthily?

                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 130. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Humphrey</hi> charges me with two Schiſms. and 1. For ſaying <hi>that an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:120105:126"/>
man muſt examine himſelf and ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein. Anſ.</hi> I ſay no ſuch thing, if examination be taken in the Apoſtles ſence for the whole worke of preparation and as oppſed to unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynes in the next vers. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28, 29 The end of examination being ſelf diſcovery and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, theſe two laſt muſt needs be included in it. Let an unregenerate man thus examine himſelf and I am confident he is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; ſo far am I from ſeperating between ſuch examination and receiving. Mr. <hi>Humphrey. Nay Mr.</hi> D. <hi>ſayes, he moſt be preſent too, but not eat; which is an other Schiſme in the Actions. Anſ.</hi> I believe all may be preſent without ſin, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I finde no prohibition to the contrary, Secondly, becauſe they may receive good by preſence, which inclimes me to believe preſence is a duty here, as at Baptiſme. Yet herein I dare not be ſo peremptory as in the other branch, that all muſt not eat. When <hi>Mr. Humphrey</hi> can make out an inſeparable union between preſence and receiving then I ſhall be ready both to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and reforme the Schiſme he charges me withall: till then he muſt excuſe me. But whereas <hi>Mr. Humphrey</hi> charges me with ſlander as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming I ſay, <hi>Let a man eat though he do not examine himſelf. Anſ.</hi> I do not remember nor can finde this paſſage in this paragraph, yet haply elſwhere I may have expreſſed as much and believe it's far from ſlander, yea ſhould be very glad were I miſtaken therein. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put it to this iſſue. Either <hi>Mr. Humphrey</hi> is of the minde the a man muſt eat though be do not examine himſelf: or he is of the contrary
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:120105:126"/>
minde, for between two contradictions there is no middle. If he be of the former minde then I have not ſlandered him. If he be of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mind then he is of our judgement, That ſelf-examination abſtractedly taken is not enough to vvarrant receiving. To evidence this, let us compare the two propoſitions. 1. Prop. <hi>Let a man eat, though he do not examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> 2. Prop. <hi>Let not a man eat unleſſe he do examine himſelf.</hi> If the former be not his judgement, then the latter muſt needs be his judgement, it being contradictory to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſo Maſter <hi>Humphrey</hi> is of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that a man muſt not eat unleſſe he do examine himſelf; namely when he either doth not examine himſelf at all, or upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he findes himſelf Evangelically unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; the end of examination being not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or principally, diſcovery, but reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which therefore muſt needs be included in Apoſtolick examination. He that tryes <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in order to diſcovery had as good not try at all; yea, ſuch tryal will aggravate his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and make him more inexcuſable as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt conviction, <hi>James</hi> 4. 17. If now I have ſlandered Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> as I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the material ſlander, though unwitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done; ſo I am not a little glad he is more of our judgement in this particular then I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly took him to be. But be it what it will, he muſt either clear me of ſlander, or accuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of errour. Yet withall, let me be bold to tell Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> That he, who ſayes, let all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, muſt by neceſſary conſequence ſay, let
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:120105:127"/>

                  <q rend="inline">Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> ib. His exceptions againſt the parable, <hi>Math.</hi> 22. are vain things.

               <p>Thirdly, If the contempt of the feaſt be the main buſineſs intended, then the higher the contempt the greater the unworthynes; but ſuch was the contempt of thoſe Murderers who therefore were excluded by the command of the Maſter, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 24.

               <p>To his two queſtions I anſwer; to the firſt, All refuſers are unworthy of Gods Ordinances, but I hope he will not count all abſteyners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers.</p>

               <p>Secondly, There is no totall omiſſion on the Chriſtians part if he prepare for and attend upon the Sacrament, but is denied actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving (whither juſtly or unjuſtly) by Church-Officers: <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:120105:129"/>Secondly, It ſmells ſtrongly of perverſneſſe that he charges me as directly oppoſing the command of Chriſt, when at the ſame time (if it be an oppoſition) him ſelf takes the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Chriſt ſayes drink ye <hi>all</hi> of it. <hi>Mr. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> ſayes <hi>all</hi> here muſt be limited to intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Church-members and to perſons not <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate; we ſay it muſt be limited to Church-members that are Evangelically wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. <hi>Mr. Humphrey</hi> in the ſame breath (as it were) cryes up his own limitation and cryes down ours.

               <p>Thirdly, ſhould I revers what he charges me to ſay <hi>pag.</hi> 47. Suppoſing it erroneous, <hi>Mr. Humphrey</hi> ſhould rather be glad than ſad at ſuch a reverſment.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I ſee more need of a candid inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation on <hi>Mr. Humphrey</hi> his part, than of a reverſment on my part. <q rend="inline">True, I ſay there, that I humbly conceive that the Miniſter may clear his own ſoul (where there is no Church-governement ſettled) if he perſwade or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn one that is viſibly unworthy not to receive, but hath no juridicall power either to admit or keep him back.</q> But did I there ſay, the Miniſter had no Paſtourall power, or that he had no power to ſuſpend his own Act? If a drunkard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after admonition will ruſh upon the Sacrament, let him take it at his own perill; I do not think the Miniſter is bound either on the one hand to drive him from the Table or on the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:120105:129"/>
other hand to deliver him the Sacrament. The Miniſter then doth neither admit nor ſuſpend him juridically; but ſuſpends onely his own Act. If a Miniſter by his Paſtourall power (where no Governement is ſettled) may admit all that are viſibly worthy, then he may be the ſame power ſuſpend thoſe who are viſibly unworthy; that is, he may deny to give them the Elements. The Logicians tell us that <hi>Contrariorum eſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem</hi>

                  </gap>. He that hath power to admit hath ſo far power to ſuſpend. Here then, by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey</hi> his leave is a <hi>medium.</hi> It's neither my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to admit a drunkard, that is to give him the Elements, nor is it my ſin to permit him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; that is to let him take the Elements him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Is not permiſſion a medium between ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and ſuſpenſion. A Miniſter unpresby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated can neither admit nor ſuſpend, but may permit.

Yet, he is ſo charitable towards me as to think I make conſcience of being at the coſt of a <hi>Salve</hi> where I have wounded any.</p>

The Sacrameut indeed is the Diſh, Chriſt the meat in that diſh; ſhould not the handmaids of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom wipe her diſhes clean on all ſides ſo far as lies in their power, that is, purge and keep pure this and other Ordinances? If his meaning be, that by Sacramentall triall we cauſe ſinfull diviſion, wound the conſciences of the weak or grieve them, and make the Sacrament a nullity; this, firſt is falſe: Secondly a new dreſſing of what is elſewhere anſwered. I pray Sir, be not offended, that we dare not make the Table of the Lord contemptible, that we dare bring no bread to the Lords Table but ſuch, as, upon grounds of charity, we apprehend to be Shew-Bread, <hi>Malach</hi> 1. v. 7. and 12.</p>
               <p>I wonder therefore Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> ſo forgets himſelf, <hi>pag.</hi> 133. as to charge me bitterly with cenſoriouſneſſe, but for noting his cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. To which I briefly anſwer:</p>
               <p n="1">1. What need I quote Chapter and verſe in a place ſo well known, and quoted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, That I charge him with cenſuring us in a Rhetorical way, did I not therein ſay the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:120105:131"/>
very truth, unleſſe <hi>Interrogation</hi> be no part of Rhetorick? Doth not M. <hi>Humphrey</hi> turn the Apoſtles aſſertion into an Interrogation, and is that no part of Rhetorick?</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, Did I frame any interpretation, but what his words muſt of neceſſity carry, unleſs he will have them ſpeak non ſenſe? He findes fault with us for doing evil that good may come; what is that evil, but want of free Admiſſion, the very ſame with Suſpenſion in a negative ſenſe? That this is the evil Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> charges us withall is evident, both by the context, and by the whole ſcope of his book. Let the Reader now judge whither I frame an interpretation, or ſpeak Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his genuine ſenſe. That Suſpenſion is not a ſin, but a duty hath been elſewhere proved; nor are we aſhamed, Sir, that you charge us with Suſpenſion as our Act and practice, but think you do us wrong by charging us with this practice as a ſin. The Act we confeſſe concerns us, but the guilt muſt reſt upon him, who charges guilt wrongfully. Is not he cenſorious, who charges me with a ſin I am not guilty of? Yet that nothing may be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in point of cenſoriouſneſſe, Mr. <hi>Humphrey, pag.</hi> 134. charges me with ſpight for forgiving him and praying for him. Lord, how doth paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and prejudice blinde a man to interpret the preateſt acts of charity a plece of ſpight and malice?</p>
               <p>Sir, I finde not fault with the terms of <hi>giving,</hi> or <hi>humbly committing</hi> your reaſons; but that you miſtake <hi>weight</hi> for <hi>number,</hi> and think you give them by <hi>weight,</hi> when you give or humbly
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:120105:131"/>
commit them onely by <hi>number.</hi> For a farewell, Mr. <hi>Humphrey,</hi> 1. Tells me, I rail at his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Secondly, Takes his leave with a ſcoff. Thirdly, To ſharpen his <hi>Sarcaſme</hi> abuſes Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and ſo concludes the firſt part of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder, whither with that piety and charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Brother and a Miniſter, I leave it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different judgements.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. p.</hi> 146. of his <hi>Rejoynder. I expreſs it juſt over the leaf as ſoon as it is to purpoſe. Anſ.</hi> In diſpute, and only by the way, I note your deſcription of Church-cenſures as defective. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians tell us that <hi>Finis</hi> is a neceſſary ingredient in our deſcription of an action, the end being eſſential to the moral goodneſs of actions. This end, Sir, you omit in your deſcription of Church-cenſures, which your mentioning in the next leaf will not ſalve. Therefore, by your leave, I was neither blind nor cruel in cenſuring, unleſs the Reſpondents diſcovery of the faylures of his Opponent againſt the rules of Logick be malice and blindneſs; and if ſo, then a Diſputant, becauſe he acts rationally in order to the conviction of his Adverſary, is blind and malicious. <note place="margin">In this I allude on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his own ſtory.</note> Such Logick is fitter for St. <hi>Albans</hi> executioner, than for a Scholar or a Divine.</p>
               <p>Next, he blames me <hi>for extending Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſures to ignorant perſons, or to any other wilful ſinners;</hi> Yet in the ſame place grants ſome Church-cenſures belong to ſuch, but not ſuſpenſion or excommunication. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Sir, I extend not Church-cenſures to ignorant perſons ſimply, but to perſons wilfully ignorant: And till Mr. <hi>H.</hi> can prove ſuch ignorance and wilfulneſs is not a great and ſcandalous ſin, he doth ill to cenſure me for ſaying they deſerve a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſure, yea ſome degrees of excommunication if perſiſted in. If <hi>this doctrine would ſoon leave him deſtitute of Church-members,</hi> as himſelf confeſſes, <hi>p.</hi> 147. Surely his Church is in a very
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:120105:134"/>
lamentable condition, whoſe members are (it ſeems) not only groſly ignorant, but alſo wilfully ignorant. I do not charge them to be ſo, but only ſhew them what a ſlur their own Miniſters argument caſts upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. ib.</hi> Dr. <hi>D. challenges all the world to ſhew him proof that perſons excommunicated may not be preſent at any publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, &amp;c. If he think ſo learnedly of himſelf, let him ſend his challenge to Dr.</hi> Hammond, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I know far better than Mr. <hi>H.</hi> or any other, that I have great reaſon to think very meanly of my ſelf, nor will I ſtand to juſtifie the manner of expreſſion, which yet had its mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or allay, would Mr. <hi>H.</hi> have pleaſed to take notice thereof, my challenge being only in order to <hi>Scripture-proof.</hi> by which I ſtill beleeve it cannot be made out, that an excommunicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to be kept from all publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yea, the Scripture ſeems to favour the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. I dare not compare with that learned <hi>Clerk</hi> he mentions, or with any other that bears the name of a Scholar or Divine, nor deſire to expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate in controverſies, which I look at as the ſhell, not the kernel of Divinity: Nor was I, or am I acted with malice in coping with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in this unhappy controverſie which himſelf (among others whom I honour in the Lord) ſtarted againſt the votes and judgement of a Parliament, aſſiſted by an Aſſembly of very pious, orthodox, and learned Divines, to the general ſadning of eminently godly perſons in the Nations, who looked at the Presbyterian Government, and the exerciſe of it in this particular, for the ſubſtance thereof, as
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:120105:135"/>
moſt conſonant to the rule, as the fruit of many prayers that have long hung upon the file in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and as the great Inſtrument under Chriſt to extirpate Ignorance, Errour, Prophaneneſs, Schiſm, &amp;c. and therefore oppoſed by ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly, by others through weakneſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, in which laſt rank I place Mr. <hi>H.</hi> however he look at me as malicious. If the Lord ſhall bleſs my poor endeavours to convince him, I ſhall think it abundantly worth my pains, though it bee to me a troubleſome work in the midſt of other weighty avocations. However, I ſhall ſubmit the iſſue to God, and ſit down in peace, that I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, though weakly endeavoured to do my duty; and hope ſome body will be the better by this poor peece, though it muſt expect to meet with much contempt and oppoſition.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.p.</hi> 147. <hi>I ſhall propoſe him only that one Text,</hi> Matth. 7. 6. <hi>Give not that which is holy unto dogs: Excommunicated perſons are generally interpreted to be dogs and ſwine; the word and prayer are holy things as well as the Sacrament (which yet was not inſtituted when this precept was firſt given, and ſo cannot hee primarily intended here) Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. All excommunicated perſons are not dogs. Even godly men upon juſt ground may be excommunicated; and I hope children are not dogs.</p>
               <p n="2">2 All dogs are not to be denied holy things. Heathen are dogs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. v. 22. 26, 27. yet may be admitted to the word preached, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Some perſons within the Church are dogs, yet muſt not be denied the Sacrament, if upon trial
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:120105:135"/>
it appear they have competent knowledge, and no ſcandal be objected or proved againſt them; the Church in cenſures being bound to proceed, <hi>Secundum allegata &amp; probata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Therefore we muſt diſtinguiſh of dogs: Some are dogs really, but not viſibly; ſuch are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural perſons undiſcovered, (theſe with due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions) can be denied no Ordinance. Others are dogs both really and viſibly; Such are Heathen, who muſt not be denied the Crums, though they may not ſit with Children at the Table. Others are ſcornful, and malicious dogs, and therefore are in an eſpecial manner unworthy of any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſo far as they are viſible muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied</p>
               <p n="1">1 The pearl of private reproof more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly there intended by our Saviour, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids private judging of any, and private reproof of ſome, unleſs it be for others ſake.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They muſt be denied that holy thing the Sacrament, which (as the Cabinet of that pearl of price) they ſleight viſibly. But as for publick prayers and preaching (unleſs they be publick Affronters and diſturbers of the very exerciſes of theſe Ordinances, which are means of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and which do not ſo much irritate their ſpleen, as being not particularly and perſonally applied againſt them) I ſee no warrant of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to thruſt any dog from them, unleſs it bee known he have committed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. In this ſenſe Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. I cordially ſubſcribe to, That ſuch dogs as do publickly blaſpheme and vent their hereſies againſt the truth, at the very time when it is delivered, are to be forced away
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:120105:136"/>
from the publick Ordinances, or ſeparated from, if the Church want co-active power (<hi>Act.</hi> 13. v. 45, 46, 50, 51. where you have both the bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the tearing dog) as well as they muſt bee denied private reproof (at leaſt for their own ſakes) where they ſcoff at, and oppoſe it private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This rule our Saviour ſeems to explain <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. v. 15-17. where the remedy riſes up gradually with the malady, and neglecting to hear is a degree of Swiniſh-trampling. But little doth Mr. <hi>H.</hi> think how he hath prejudiced his own cauſe by this quotation of Reverend Mr. <hi>Perkins, pag.</hi> 148. eſpecially where in a Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, he bids the Reader (Mark that) Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his words quoted there by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">Indeed, if the party be excommunicated for ſome particular crime, &amp;c. then although he be excluded from communion in the Sacrament and Prayer (Mark that) yet may he be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to hear the word to help him to repent, which is the end of all Church-cenſures.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Is not Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> here clear that ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons excommunicated, yet may be admitted to the word preached, and that in order to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion? And what is our ſuſpenſion in the rigor of it, but an excommunication from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with an admiſſion at the ſame time to the word preached? Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> then is a profeſt friend to ſuſpenſion, which is alſo beholding to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> for affording it ſo honourable a teſtimony. You will ſay, I but Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> excludes ſuch from prayer alſo. <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, and probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he looked not at prayer as a converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, which had he done, its not likely he
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:120105:136"/>
would have been againſt preſence either at Word, Prayer, or Sacrament, by which all that are cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, may receive good, although they do not actually receive the elements.</p>
               <p n="5">5 If the Sacrament be not primarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here, becauſe this precept was given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords Supper was inſtituted; no more was it primarily intended in the wedding feaſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. upon the ſame account; which yet Mr. <hi>H.</hi> builds upon as a bottome for free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Its enough for our purpoſe, Firſt, That the Sacrament is an holy thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his own grant, its to be denied to ſome dogs, to whom other holy things are not to be denied, namely, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and perſons <hi>jure</hi> excommunicated, to which laſt at leaſt he yeelds it may be denied.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That upon Scripture-ground it is to be denied to ſome dogs within the Church, yea to real children. But neither muſt <hi>holy things,</hi> nor <hi>dogs</hi> be underſtood univerſally, which both the manner of expreſſion, and our Saviours reaſon hint ſufficiently, where a pearl is, Firſt, caſt away; Secondly, expoſed to contempt; Thirdly, expoſes the giver to danger, there its not to be tendered <hi>caeteris paribus.</hi> An indefinite Propoſition is not equivalent to an univerſal, unleſs <hi>in materiâ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſariâ.</hi> He that ſayes abſolutely, No holy thing muſt be given to any dog, doth not only ſin againſt faith, as corrupting the Text, but alſo againſt charity, as cutting off innumerable perſons from all means of converſion.</p>
               <p>His diſtinction <hi>p.</hi> 148. of <hi>real</hi> &amp; <hi>relative</hi> excluſion is pithy, pertinent, and well expreſs'd, and may do very much to compound our controverſie, if paſſion
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:120105:137"/>
and prejudice were on both hands laid aſide. We grant;</p>
               <p>Firſt, That an heathen, or excommunicated perſon, hath no relative intereſt in any publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, the former being no Church-member, the latter being cut off from Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That all Church-members have both a real and relative intereſt in all Ordinances in <hi>actu primo,</hi> or <hi>ſignato,</hi> but not <hi>in actu ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> or <hi>exercito,</hi> as a Jew, or a Prieſt, had right to holy things, but might not at all times act that right, namely, if he were unclean, &amp;c. And if their uncleanneſs were perpetual, they might for ever be ſecluded from holy things, as in the caſe of leproſie, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 26. 21. Proportionably ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion is no bar either to real or relative intereſt, but only with-holds the actual injoyment of that intereſt till the party intereſted be actually fit for that injoyment (at leaſt viſibly) which otherwiſe would prejudice, but not benefit him. The point of difference between us, and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is not <hi>real</hi> or <hi>relative intereſt,</hi> but <hi>actual injoyment</hi> of that intereſt, and that only too as to actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. pag.</hi> 149. <hi>I hold a man is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred actual receiving by excommunication. Mr.</hi> Drake <hi>will have him to be debarred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I pray Sir, forget not your ſelf, Do not you hold perſons <hi>jure</hi> excommunicated, may be debarred actual receiving? Conſult <hi>page</hi> 21. of your <hi>Rejoynder.</hi> I hope perſons <hi>jure</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated are not actually excommunicated; therefore Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will have ſome intelligent
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:120105:137"/>
Church-members debarred actual receiving, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actual excommunication, and what is this but ſuſpenſion? May Mr. <hi>H.</hi> diſtinguiſh between excommunication <hi>ipſo jure &amp; de facto,</hi> and may not I diſtinguiſh between receiving <hi>ipſo jure, &amp; de facto.</hi> Grant all Church-members <hi>as ſuch,</hi> may be receivers <hi>ipſo jure</hi> ſo they be not receivers <hi>de facto,</hi> we ſhall ſoon put an iſſue to this controverſie with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Is there not an admiſſion <hi>de jure &amp; de facto,</hi> as well as an excommunication <hi>de jure &amp; de facto?</hi> A perſon excommunicated <hi>de jure,</hi> but not <hi>de facto,</hi> is as truly a Church-member as a perſon admitted <hi>de jure,</hi> but not <hi>de facto;</hi> and if the former may be ſuſpended, notwithſtanding his Church-memberſhip, I pray why not the latter?</p>
               <p>By this collation it further appears, That Church-memberſhip even in intelligent perſons, is not the adequate reaſon of actual receiving. A perſon <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate, is ſtill externally in Covenant (in Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his ſenſe) as being a Church-member, and yet may be debarred the external ſeal thereof; witneſs Mr. <hi>H. pag.</hi> 21, 22. of his <hi>Rejoynder;</hi> when Mr. <hi>H.</hi> can untie this Riddle of his own making, he will teach us to untie the Riddle he puts upon us <hi>page</hi> 150. where likewiſe he ſayes, but proves not, <hi>That excluding men from the Sacrament doth not bind or retain their ſins.</hi> This is falſe, if ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Juridical ſuſpenſion, or Paſtoral ſuſpenſion, in ſome caſes.</p>
               <p>Somewhat he would bring there like an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from a miſ-underſtanding of <hi>Matth.</hi> 1619 <hi>as if there were no cenſure of the Keyes without excluſion from the Church;</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting in the mean time, his own diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Chancel.</hi> Hath the houſe of God but one room, one door? or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not a man be ſhut out of the <hi>Chancel,</hi> but he muſt needs be thereby ſhut out of the <hi>Church?</hi> Cannot a Father ſhut his childe out of the Parlor, but he muſt needs ſhut him quite out of doors? True, ſome perſons cenſured muſt be to thee as heathen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. but muſt all perſons cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured be ſo? Surely the Apoſtle is more charitable, 2 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 3. v. 14 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 151. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſayes, <hi>That the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of excommunication among the Jews called Cherem, may put Mr.</hi> Drake <hi>to ſhame, that ſo blindly aſſerts the parallel,</hi> p. 21. <hi>and yet every where denies the matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Good words, I pray Sir; <hi>page</hi> 21. and 22. of my Bar, I prove the Antiquity of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion from the practice of the Jews, and of the ancient Greek Church; as alſo that with them it was a degree of excommunication, as juridical ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion is with us. I neither aſſert, nor juſtifie their practice univerſally, much leſs their exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of perſons excommunicated from all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances. Cannot I quote their practice in favour of ſuſpenſion, but I muſt needs juſtifie what ever was in uſe among them in point of excommunication? Such blind imputations, I am ſure ſhould ſhame Mr. <hi>H.</hi> who it ſeems can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſtinguiſh between the improving of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or practice, and the owning of all the aberrations that attend upon that practice.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. ib. Its a very fond conceit of Mr.</hi> D. <hi>to make two degrees of excommunication beneath diſmemberſhip, that is, two degrees of putting men out of the Church before
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:120105:138"/>
they be put out of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhould do well to tell the Ancient Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of the <hi>Greeks, &amp;c.</hi> that their conceit is fond in making two or three degrees of excommunication before diſmember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It was their conceit before it was mine, nor am I of their conceit in every particular about excommunication, or its degrees, though I will not ſay their conceit was <hi>fond:</hi> I leave that work to Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, What is excommunication (in the very notion of it) but a turning or keeping out of communion: And becauſe turning out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is gradual, therefore excommunication muſt needs be gradual. He that is turned out of any part of communion, is as truly, though not as much, turned out of communion, as he that is turned out of all communion: Sacramental communion is part of communion, from which he that is turned away, is truly turned out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as to that particular, and therefore is truly excommunicated, though not diſmembred. What ever therefore himſelf, or others may think of thoſe Texts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. and 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 14. is not the Queſtion, but what thoſe Texts do really hold forth, which becauſe they have been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, I here forbear.</p>

                  <hi>Excommunication refers directly to Church memberſhip, and conſequentially only to the Ordinances; ſo that a man muſt be put out of the Church, or elſe he cannot legally be put from the Communion.

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> two degrees of excommunication, at leaſt referring directly to ſome Ordinance, namely the Lords Supper; from which the party ſuſpended is ſeparated really; the party diſmembred is ſeparated both really and relatively. His illuſtration is as weak as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, the Leper being kept from the Camp (though not ſolely, yet) principally that he might be kept from ſome parts of worſhip. Take <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> for inſtance, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 21. his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie cu: him off not only from Civil, but alſo
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:120105:139"/>
from Sacred imployments. This is further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the practice of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who pitched a Tabernacle without the Camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the Congregation, <hi>Exod</hi> 33. 7. Doth Mr. <hi>H.</hi> think a Leper without the Camp might come to that Tabernacle to ſeek the Lord, as other Iſraelites that were clean did and might? If his preſence would defile the Camp, <hi>Num.</hi> 5. 3. would it not much more defile the Tabernacle; or was not Gods preſence more eminently in the Tabernacle than in the Camp? He was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kept from the Camp, that he might be kept from communion in ſome part of worſhip; not ſimply from communion in worſhip, becauſe he was kept from the Camp; for then he might have been admitted to worſhip in the Tabernacle when it was without the Camp, which is evidently falſe.</p>
               <p>What Mr. <hi>H.</hi> notes <hi>page</hi> 154. of the practice of gathered Churches, it hath been ſpoke too formerly. For his exception againſt my reaſon, <hi>à majori,</hi> illuſtrated by the ſimilitude of a Judge: He anſwers himſelf, <hi>page</hi> 155. in theſe words, <hi>I think when a man is relatively deprived fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in general, the Church may uſe mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſeverity to a real permiſſion of him to ſome Ordinances (and ſo perhaps for civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe) according to prudence, for his edification or deſtruction.</hi> What ſpeak theſe words, but that the Church may admit an excommunicated perſon to ſome Ordinances, who yet by Gods command is debarred all Ordinances, if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> define excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication rightly? Is not this to ſet the Church above Scripture, and to allow her power of mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where God commands ſeverity? Beſides if the Church may uſe mitigation after diſmembring, why
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:120105:140"/>
not alſo before it? If ſhe may admit a diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred perſon to ſome Ordinances, why may ſhe not ſuſpend an undiſmembred perſon from ſome Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; yea what in effect is her greater excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication mitigated, but ſuſpenſion? To keep to his own terms, That Magiſtrate who may according to Law inflict a greater puniſhment, may accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law inflict the leſſer puniſhment. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, if the Church may diſmember a perſon, ſhe may ſuſpend him, but both according to Chriſts Law, which is the Goſpel. That the Church doth it according to Law hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proved, which therefore I ſhall not repeat.</p>
               <p>But, I pray Sir, may a Judge mitigate a ſevere ſentence when paſſed, and might he not before have pronounced a milder ſentence? May a Judge after ſentence of Confiſcation and Death pronounced, mitigate the execution only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation, and might not the ſame Judge before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand have paſſed a milder ſentence of confiſcation only? In like manner, may the Church after ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of diſmembring admit the perſon diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to ſome Ordinances, and may not ſhe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend the ſame perſon from ſome Ordinance without diſmembring him? Will Mr. <hi>H.</hi> miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate after the ſentence of diſmembring, and may not we mitigate before the ſentence of diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring? May he break a poor mans head, and then give him a plaiſter, and may not we prevent both the fraction and plaiſter by a little ſcratch? (ſuch is ſuſpenſion to diſmembring, eſpecially as managed by us) If therefore ſuſpenſion be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or injury, its an error on the right hand by too much mildneſs. I pray Sir, forgive us this wrong. I am glad the Presbyterians, who were
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:120105:140"/>
looked at as a company of rigid fellows, are now at laſt found guilty (as it ſeems) of too much lenity and moderation.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> p. 155. <hi>Suſpenſion is null without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip; inſomuch that if a Jew were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Niddui (which was their loweſt degree) if unabſolved, his children might not be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed: And why not, but that they reckoned him no Church member?</hi>

               <p n="2">2. His confirmation drawn from the practice of the Jews is weak, it being not probable that he who might teach ordinarily in the Church, was diſmembred from the Church. 3. In denying Circumciſion to the Males of a perſon under Nid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dui, the Jews were wife above that which was written, ſuppoſing the father had been diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by that degree of Excommunication, and that becauſe the childe might have been circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the right of his mother or grand-father, &amp;c. To me, it ſeems probable, the Jews might deny Circumciſion in the aforeſaid caſe, out of prudence, the more effectually by that means to humble and bring in the Patent: But I ſee no Scripture warrant for it, and therefore may here uſe the words of our Saviour, <hi>From the beginning it was not ſo,</hi> Mat. 19. 8.

Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is directly oppoſite (not ſimply to Church-memberſhip, but) to Communication or <hi>Communion,</hi> a term given eſpecially to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which Communion, becauſe it is gradual, therfore its oppoſite Excommunication muſt needs be gradual alſo. Cannot a member be deprived communion, unleſs it be cut off? I had thought a Ligature as well as Exciſion, might have deprived my finger of communion with my body, and might prove far better phyſick than Exciſion or Mutilation. If the Ligature of ſuſpenſion will cure, its cruelty (in my poor judgement) to cut off a Member. A <hi>Brother</hi> in Scripture phraſe is a Church-member, though under a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſure; compare 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. with 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 14, 15.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> p. 156. <hi>God forbid but we ſhould put a diſtinction between ſins that ſtand not with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and that ſtand not with publike profeſſion.

                  </q> As Mr. <hi>H.</hi> quotes my words, I grant there is much ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity; to inſtance in one, and a groſs one.

                  <q rend="inline">(<hi>They partake not of any ſin in their receiving, more than in their hearing and praying</hi>)</q> are erroneous. For clearing whereof note, we may ſin two ways about our duty: 1. In the matter. 2. In the manner: Proportionably two ways I may partake of other mens ſins: 1. If I do not inſtruct and warn them about their duty, both for matter and manner, where I am called ſo to do. 2. If I admit them to do that which <hi>inſtatu quo</hi> they are bound to forbear, and I am bound in my place to endeavor to keep them from. To apply this, I ſin not in the matter by admitting any to prayer or hearing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be not diſturbers, &amp;c. but I ſin in the very matter, by admitting ſome to receiving, who ought not to be admitted; elſe how can perſons <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate, be denyed the Sacrament? we preach to, and pray for, and with, the vileſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors that are ready to be ſacrificed to Juſtice,

In the former I may be guilty, both in matter and manner, not ſo in the latter, but onely in the manner. We acknowledge it our duty, and profeſs it our practice, to excite, call and provoke all intelligent Church-members to receive; and to counſel, fit, and prepare them for the Sacrament: but too many care not to come, and divers who affect to come, are extreamly unwilling to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled, fitted and prepared by us as they ought. <hi>Hinc, hinc, illae Lachrymae.</hi> We wiſh all Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors were worthy Receivers, we charge all to make conſcience to fit themſelves, we offer our ſelves to help to fit them, and cordially admit thoſe who are viſibly fit, waiting upon others, till God give them real and viſible fitneſs, but till viſibly fit, we dare not admit them.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> By <hi>them</hi> he means either the parties cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, or the Congregation. I think Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and particularly ſuſpenſion, do much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them both: the party cenſured, to bring him

to repentance; the beſt of the Congregation in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their ſatisfaction, who are much offended by the admiſſion of perſons viſibly unworthy; and the whole Congregation, who by the ſuſpenſion of any are warned to take heed of his ſins, left they be ſuſpended as well as he: as alſo to prevent that guilt which would defile them, ſhould they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his admiſsion, whom they know to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. Such conſenters are they, who after due admonition in private, do not give notice to the Church of a perſon they know to be unworthy; as alſo thoſe Church Officers, who admit him in the like caſe. As Church-members, we are bound in the uſe of all lawful means to prevent one the others ſins; Receiving is a ſin in perſons viſibly unworthy; therefore Church-members, as ſuch, are bound to prevent it. Some acts are eſſentially ſinful, which never can be done by any; ſome are accidentally ſinful, by the manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſome are relatively ſinful, when done by a perſon uncapable, as when a private perſon takes upon him the office of a Judge: Here judging is not eſſentially evil, for then none might judge; nor upon the ſuppoſition is it accidentally evil, as to the manner of judging, for the private perſon may paſs a right judgement: but its relatively evil, becauſe a private perſon takes upon him the work of a publike perſon; and ſuch judging we truly ſay is evil <hi>in fieri,</hi> though it be not eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil. In like manner, a perſon receiving, who ought not to receive; ſins in the <hi>fieri,</hi> as to the act of receiving, though the act of receiving be not a ſin eſſentially, but onely relatively. I hope all perſons muſt not practice all affirmative precepts: to judge and preach are duties, muſt all men

therefore judge and preach? Are not the very acts of judging and preaching ſins in ſome perſons? They are not ſo eſſentially, but relatively when men who are not called undertake theſe works.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> p. 158. <hi>It is indeed the great fallacy here that miſleads many, when they plead our duty of watching over others, &amp;c. they winde it all in ſtill in order to the Sacrament, as if they were to be done meerly in reference unto it, when as they are each of them diſtinct duties, and the neglect of, or doing one, is no ground or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of the other.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, Watching over others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Not partaking in their ſins.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Getting the ſcandalous to be cenſured.</p>
               <p>Here firſt, by way of conceſſion we winde them all in, in order to the Sacrament, but not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reference to it; That is Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his fallacy wherewith he would fain deceive the Reader. Whereas we make uſe of all three in order to private communion, and in order to diſmembring, as well as in order to ſuſpenſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, True, They are each of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct duties; but its falſe, That the neglect of, or doing the one, is no ground or hindrance of the other. For firſt, Omiſſion of the one (whether it be by neglect, or otherwiſe) is a ground for the omiſſion of the other.</p>
               <p>I muſt not reprove my neighbour, unleſs I firſt watch over him, it being a ſin to reprove blindly, which he muſt needs be guilty of, that obſerves not;</p>
               <p>Firſt, The ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The perſon committing that ſin. He
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:120105:145"/>
that watches not, is it any wonder if he miſtake either the fact, or perſon, or both?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Its falſe, That doing the one is no ground of doing the other; for I muſt watch over others, that I may reprove and admoniſh (as well as incourage) them, leſt I partake of their ſins: And I muſt take heed I partake not of their ſins upon this account among others, that I may be the fitter to reprove and admoniſh them, and more effectually inſtrumental to get the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cenſured; ſince fellow delinquents will never be forward to call each other to account. Is it not more probable the intire part of the Church will call the corrupt part thereof to account, rather than the corrupt part will call it ſelf to an account? we grant the three forementioned duties are diſtinct, but are they not therefore copulative? Diſtinction I hope is no enemy to union, whether in a way of co-ordination or of ſubordination. By all it appears, there is a ſubordination of duties, as well as of ſins: And as ſome ſins cannot be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teed without other previous ſins; ſo ſome duties cannot be performed without other foregoing du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of which nature is the act of receiving, in order whereunto ſelf-examination is ever neceſſary; and Church-examination alſo where it may regularly be had; or at leaſt in its room Paſtoral-examination.</p>

               <p>Secondly, He tells us, <hi>Hope is taken here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectivè for Chriſtian doctrine, not ſubjectivè for the truth of grace we would inquire into.</hi>

The notions indeed are diſtinct, but the things themſelves ever go together. <note place="margin">My mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, That hope can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>in actu exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,</hi> but it muſt flow from a principle, and tend to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The very application of this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is contrary to the Text; The Apoſtle bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us be ready to give a reaſon of the hope

And what I pray is hope ſubjective, but the grace of hope, which therefore the Apoſtle calls us to give a reaſon of, againſt Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his gloſs. Its a contradiction to ſay, I hope objectively in the word of the Goſpel, and I do not hope ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively in the word of the Goſpel, and all one as to ſay, I hope in Chriſt, and yet I do not hope in Chriſt.</p>

               <p>True, as Mr <hi>H.</hi> notes <hi>p.</hi> 162. <hi>A natural man ſins in praying, hearing, &amp;c. yet muſt pray and hear.</hi> But there is not <hi>par ratio</hi> in receiving, as hath been formerly ſhewed.

Proportionably, a perſon may be uncapable of one Ordinance <hi>in ſtatu quô,</hi> who in the ſame ſtate is capable of other Ordinances; But of this formerly.</p>
               <p>A perjured perſon will not be admitted to ſwear, and ſhall the ſame perſon be admitted to the Sacrament upon the bare account Church memberſhip? which (as a relation to

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if Chriſt did bid all Church-members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, then receiving were not morally impoſſible to any, though never ſo bad, but this is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion begged, nor can M. <hi>H.</hi> prove that indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:120105:152"/>
Church upon juſt ground may enquire after the one as well as after the other; ſince I may be a Church-member, and not have hiſtorical faith, or may have hiſtorical faith, and not be a Church-member: And if the Church may enquire after faith of aſſent, which is ſecret, why not alſo after faith of adherence? I think this is to the purpoſe, though not to M. <hi>H.</hi> his purpoſe, and will ſoon overthrow his free admiſsion. Beſides, its not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication ſimply takes away my right to the Sacrament, but a juſt excommunication, otherwiſe mans wickedneſs may rob me of my right to Chriſts Ordinance, which is impoſsible. My right to the Sacrament depends more upon my faith, than upon my Church-memberſhip; nor do I ſimply forfeit my right, becauſe the Church excommunicates me, but the Church ought to excommunicate me, becauſe I forfeit my right, which forfeiture the Church takes by excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: When therefore viſible faith is contradicted by viſible profaneneſs, that man hath viſibly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his right to the Sacrament, and the Church by ſuſpenſion or excommunication, doth but take the forfeiture. True, he may in ſome ſenſe have <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> but he hath not <hi>jus in re,</hi> till he make up the breach by viſible faith and repentance; yea, though a man have true juſtifying faith, yet by groſs ſcandai he may viſibly contradict his faith, and ſo forfeit his <hi>jus in re.</hi> Withal, it will be very hard for M. <hi>H.</hi> to prove, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had onely hiſtorical faith: The will follows the laſt dictate of the underſtanding, and ſo far forth as I aſſent to Chriſts ſufficiency and willingneſs to ſave me, there is ſome propenſion in the will to reſt on him for ſalvation, though in hypocrites

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Argument to confirm this principle is very weak; and by proportion, we might as well argue, God ingages not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert man by the word preached; If he did, then every hearer ſhould beconverted, doth he not know that though an Ordinance be converting, yet ſtill God reſerves to himſelf his own liberty of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, when and whom he pleaſes, the Ordinances being not natural, but arbitrary means of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the hands of God.</p>

Initial faith is infuſed, not acquired, gradual faith is got both by infuſion and acquiſition.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is <hi>gratis dictum:</hi> I had thought the Sacrament had ſealed the whole Covenant of grace, and ſo the abſolute Covenant: It ſeals that <hi>Chriſts blood is ſhed for many,</hi> as well as for thoſe believers, that at preſent partake of it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 20.

                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:120105:158"/>That the conditional Covenant is ſealed (though not ſolely) we deny not. But that we are to take <hi>ſealing</hi> for <hi>conveying</hi> or <hi>exhibiting,</hi> is a new light of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> p. 176. this is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found diſtinct offices and uſes of the Sacrament, and to fight againſt ſenſe and experience.</p>
               <p>True, the Sacrament ſignifies, ſeals and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes, but its ſignification is not its ſealing, nor is its ſealing its conveying. Let a Bond or Indenture be ſigned and ſealed, there is no conveyance till it be delivered. Therefore ſome of the Sacramental actions do both ſignifie, ſeal, and convey the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; they ſignifie and ſeal the letter of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, they convey as inſtruments the good things promiſed to beleevers; yea, that very act of faith, whereby a worthy receiver apprehends Chriſt at the Sacrament is wrought in him inſtrumentally by the Sacrament. This one thing rightly conſidered, will ſhake univerſal admiſſion, for though all may be admitted to ſee the Covenant ſigned and ſealed even to themſelves conditionally; yet how can Chriſts officers convey the Covenant inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to any, unleſs they have a <hi>charitative</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that Chriſt hath conveyed it to that perſon particularly?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ib. <hi>A moral inſtrument acts not Phyſically. To ſpeak freely in this ſenſe of obſignation, the Sacrament doth no more ſanctifie us than glorifie us, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Its enough for us it acts really as an Inſtrument; I hope a moral inſtrument, is a real Inſtrument, though it be not a phyſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, otherwiſe the Devil was not an inſtrument of our firſt patents fall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſay, The Sacrament is an inſtrument,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:120105:158"/>
becauſe its an arbitrary means in the hand of God to convey the benefits of the Covenant gradually to the worthy receiver, the Lord at the Sacrament in a eſpecial manner giving him delivery and ſeiſin; as by delivery of a bond, there is not only a conveying of parchment, writing and ſeal, but alſo and principally of the good things ſpecified in that Deed, which are not conveyed by writing, ſigning, or ſealing, but only by <hi>delivery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Withall, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> may as well ſay, The word preached doth not ſanctifie gradually, becauſe its not a phyſical, but a moral inſtrument. Both Word and Sacrament are real Inſtruments of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; the word both to the regenerate and unregenerate, the Sacrament only to the worthy receiver, I mean <hi>quantum ad praeſens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 177. Mr. <hi>H. charges me to be cenſorious,</hi> but why, or in what <hi>nè gru quidem.</hi> Is not this really to prove himſelf cenſorious? Further, we grant the tenor of the Covenant is ſeald to all preſent (that is, the good things of the Covenant are conditionally ſealed to them) whether they receive or no, which therefore is no argument to prove free admiſſion, but only free preſence or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance at the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>But whereas he adds <hi>ib. There can be no ſeal to a blank ſo long as there is truth and writing in the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This in ſome reſpect is a truth, but not to the purpoſe: Did I ever affirm the ſeal was put to a blank as to the Goſpel ſealed? We grant there is no real blank at the Sacrament, but there are many perſonal blanks. The ſeal of the Sacrament, and of the Spirit ſhould ever go together, and how can I ſeal him with the Sacrament, whom I have
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:120105:159"/>
ground to beleeve the Spirit hath not ſealed. Hence principally flows evidence in the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spirit together with the Sacrament ſeals the worthy receiver, and doth not only ſeal to him. In Circumciſion, not only the Covenant, but alſo the perſon was ſealed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. many perſons were ſealed: The promiſe ſecures not only good things for beleevers, but alſo beleevers for thoſe good things, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. and what the Covenant holds forth, that the Sacrament ſeale.</p>
               <p n="1">True, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> notes <hi>p.</hi> 178. <hi>God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to baptize all Infants within the Church, and to admit all viſible Saints, all which yet have not the benefits of the Covenant exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in a right ſenſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is this againſt us who are bound in charity to judge or hope they are real Saints, till they contradict this judgement of charity by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible prophaneneſs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. True, <hi>Chriſt was baptized to fulfil all righteouſneſs,</hi> but is it a fulfilling of righteouſneſs to receive unworthily?</p>

ſhall neither counſel, nor eaſily admit any to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt, and thereby to ſeal relative judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. True, <hi>To ſome unworthy abſtainers the Sacrament is a ſavor of death.</hi> But I hope Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will be more charitable than to aſſert that all who abſtain at preſent are unworthy abſtayners.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. ib. By way of inquiry I queſtion, how Gods eſtabliſhing his Covenant by way of ſeal does import this exhibition of the effectual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to thoſe he ſeals?</hi>

               <p n="1">

               <p n="2">2 With us, Gods ſealing of the Covenant, doth not alwayes import exhibition of the benefits of the Covenant, we holding that <hi>ſealing</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi> are two diſtinct Sacramental actions.

               <p>His inference <hi>p.</hi> 179. hangs upon the premiſes like a rope of ſand: <hi>Therefore Mr.</hi> Drake <hi>muſt affirm here, that God ſeals to a blank (which he moſt deſperately doth) or that this Objection comes to nothing.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here is Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his great error, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake <hi>union</hi> for <hi>confuſion.</hi> Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> thinks, that on the receivers part, the inward and outward Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and ſealing ſhould go together, and that he who wants the inward ſeal ſhould not dare to meddle with the outward ſeal. He doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the inward and outward ſeal, as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> doth <hi>ſealing</hi> and <hi>exhibiting,</hi> by making them all one, but unites the inward and outward ſeal together in point of duty on the receivers part.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. ib. If the ſeal be ſet to a blank until Gods Law is written in the heart, then no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal can apply the ſeal to any, ſeeing that cannot be diſcerned by any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a meer <hi>non ſequitur.</hi> A Miniſter may without ſin ſet the ſeal to a blank, where in charity he is bound to judge or hope that perſon is no blank; and this he is bound to hope of all that have competent knowledge, and live without ſcandal. The receiver muſt act by the rule of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:120105:160"/>
                  <hi>reality,</hi> the Church by the rule of <hi>viſibility.</hi> I do not then contradict my ſelf when I ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 72. of my <hi>Bar, That truth of grace in the heart is not the rule of our admiſsion.</hi> Grace real is the rule of an intelligent Church-members receiving, but grace viſible is the rule of the Churches ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, whether it be real, or no.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. ib. Now I pray note it, If Mr.</hi> D. <hi>apply theſe texts,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 3. Heb. 8. 10. <hi>(which ſpeak only of the inward writing) to confirm the Objection, that the Seal is ſet to a Blank if all be admitted, then the world muſt know that the truth of grace is his rule, or elſe the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant written in the heart is not truth of grace with Mr.</hi> Drake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Its apparent by my text, I brought the fore-quoted places for illuſtration, not for proof of the Objection, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> therefore might well come with an <hi>if;</hi> But what <hi>if</hi> Mr. <hi>Drake</hi> did not bring thoſe places to prove the Objection, let the Reader conſult my text, <hi>p.</hi> 123. of my <hi>Bar,</hi> where he will eaſily perceive Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his foul play with me in this particular, who to faſten an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity upon me would fain confound the rule of Admiſſion with the rule of Receiving. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> cannot be ignorant that our principles are theſe:</p>

If the Miniſter who is Gods Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor ſeals to a viſible Blank, it is ſuch an heinous ſin, he ſays, as murdering Chriſt; and yet does he affirm that God ſets his ſeal to a viſible Blank without ſcruple. It is no wonder the man deals ſo courſly with me, that uſes ſuch rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil language towards God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such abſurd and unreaſonable imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theſe, make it too ſuſpitious, that M. <hi>H.</hi> diſputes rather for victory, than for truth. I hope he will not dare to ſay in cold blood, that thoſe expreſſions of mine vent any thing of rude lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to God; but that in the very letter, as well as in their ſenſe, they give unto God the glory of his Soveraignty, who is not bound (but where himſelf pleaſeth) to the rules by which he bindes his creatures.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>If it be irregular in the Miniſter to ſeal to a viſible Blank, why not in God alſo? If the Miniſter murther Chriſt by ſealing to a viſible Blank, how is God free, who doth the ſame thing?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Miniſter is guilty, becauſe it pleaſed God to make it murder, by conſent in him to ſeal to a viſible Blank: but who can give law to God, and make it murder, by conſent in God, to ſeal to a viſible Blank? Its murder in me to take away my neighbors life at pleaſure: I hope M. <hi>H.</hi> will not infer, that therefore its murder in God to take away any mans life at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not God by ſealing to a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Abſurd. When God knowingly and profeſſedly ſeals to Blanks, how can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that his deſign in ſealing is to teſtifie they are no Blanks. God indeed by ſealing to a Blank, bindes that Blank to labor for the writing; but its <hi>contradictio in adjecto</hi> to ſay, that ſealing to a Blank, makes that Blank no Blank. Its not the ſeal, but the writing, makes a paper or parchment no Blank: nor is it the ſeal of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but the writing of the Spirit, makes a Church-member a real Saint, or an Epiſtle of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But then why may not the Miniſter by ſealing to a viſible Blank, binde that Blank to labor for the writing, as God doth? (<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a ſealing here by way of admiſſion; for otherwiſe the Covenant is ſealed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conditionally, not onely to the receivers, but alſo to all preſent, yea, though they be very Heathen, who yet are not ſealed by receiving the Sacrament.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe he hath no warrant to ſeal to that Blank in that manner; the rule being, that perſons muſt 1. Be Church-members. And 2. Viſibly worthy, before the Miniſter ſeal to them by admiſſion. But who can binde God to this rule?</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But is not this the very language of the Sacrament,</hi> Chriſt is thine, &amp;c. <hi>And how can God ſeal this to a perſon that hath no part in Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The natural language of the Sacrament, as well as of the Covenant, to whomſoever it is
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:120105:162"/>
proclaimed, is, <hi>Chriſt is thine, &amp;c.</hi> This gift is mine, 1. By way of tender. 2. By way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. That Chriſt is theirs by way of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, God ſeals by the Sacrament to all preſent, whether they receive or not. That Chriſt is theirs by way of acceptance and poſſeſſion, God ſeals to no receiver, but the worthy receiver. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſays to all preſent, Chriſt is thine condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and by way of offer; but to the worthy Communicant, it ſays, by way of evidence, Chriſt is thine, as ſure as the outward elements are thine, being received by thee; and that becauſe he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the condition of believing; which condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion yet is promiſed in the Covenant, and wrought inſtrumentally in the Sacrament, which acts faith objectively as a ſign and ſeal; but effectively, as an inſtrument, faith apprehending Chriſt through the Sacrament, as the eye doth an object through a Perſpective-glaſs; yea, the Sacrament doth not onely clear the object, but alſo ſtrengthens the viſive faculty of the ſoul, by drawing a freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of viſual Spirits from Chriſt the head.</p>
               <p>My meaning (in all hath been ſaid) is, that God, by the Sacrament applied to any, doth not teſtifie to ſuch a receiver, that he hath truth of grace; though by receiving, every Communicant be obliged to act grace: But the Miniſter, by giving the Sacrament to any, teſtifies his perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or hope, that ſuch a one hath truth of grace; which perſwaſion, or hope, is grounded upon that competent knowledge and good affections (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with immunity from ſcandal) that he findes, upon tryal, or other good evidence, to be in ſuch a Communicant.</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>To which I briefly anſwer, A perſon may be ſaid to be a viſible Saint two ways: 1. Relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he is a Church-member, born and bred in the Church. 2. Abſolutely, as he walks up vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to his profeſſion. Now, that God would have all relatively viſible Saints (which are M. <hi>H.</hi> his viſible Saints, though they be abſolutely viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Devils) admitted, is 1. Againſt the truth. 2. Againſt the practice of the ancient and modern Church. 3. Againſt M. <hi>H.</hi> his own profeſsion, ſince perſons <hi>ip ſo jure</hi> excommunicate, are ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Saints, yet he allows their ſuſpenſion. That root of bitterneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 15. was relatively a viſible Saint, as being a Church-member; but abſolutely he was a viſible Devil. The Lord keep me from giving my vote for the admiſſion of ſuch viſible Saints.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>H.</hi> ib. <hi>Its M.</hi> Drakes <hi>error to ſay, there are any viſible Blanks in the Church, for how then can we baptize all children? A viſible Blank is one viſibly out of Covenant: But to be in a Church-ſtate, is to be externally or viſibly in Covenant, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Then its M. <hi>Drakes</hi> great error to ſay, there are any viſibly profane in the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We baptize all children in the Church (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others) upon this account, becauſe none of them are viſible Blanks; knowledge we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not from them, nor are they guilty of any ſcandal. Beſides, we look at their foederal holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in either of their Parents, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. or in their grand Parents right, who may undertake for their Chriſtian education, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5.

3. The ſame perſon, at the ſame time (though not in the ſame reſpect) may be viſibly in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and viſibly out of Covenant.

They who viſibly break the Covenant, by lying in viſible impenitency and unbelief, are viſibly out of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in an abſolute ſenſe, though at the ſame time they are viſibly in Covenant in a relative ſenſe, as not being excommunicated. Such were many of the Iſraelites, who are called the <hi>holy people,</hi> Dan. 12. 7. and <hi>Gods people,</hi> Hoſ. 4. <hi>v.</hi>6. 8.12. and 11. 7. yet <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1, 9. <hi>Ye are not my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Your mother is not my wife.</hi> Theſe ſeeming contradictions are eaſily reconciled, by diſtinguiſhing between Gods people relatively and abſolutely conſidered: They were Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by external Covenant-relation, as are all Church-members: they were not Gods people by an external holy carriage, ſuitable to their external holy relation. Such <hi>Lo-Ammies,</hi> though in ſome ſenſe <hi>Ammies,</hi> we dare not admit to the Sacrament, till by viſible repentance their name is made <hi>Ruchamah,</hi> and <hi>Ammi,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 1.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Church takes the forfeiture in part, by ſuſpenſion: but that ſhe muſt take the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:120105:163"/>
higheſt forfeiture at the firſt bout by excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, is both falſe doctrine, and uncharitable doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Note here from M. <hi>H.</hi> that among Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent perſons, ſome are Church-members <hi>de jure,</hi> others onely <hi>de facto.</hi>

The point of difference is now brought to a narrower compaſs; and could we but agree about the character of a Church-member <hi>de jure,</hi> our controverſie would ſoon come to iſſue. Now Church-memberſhip being a relation, it muſt needs have a foundation. The foundation of Church-memberſhip <hi>de facto</hi> in intelligent perſons, is Admiſſion to that Society; the foundation of Church-memberſhip <hi>de jure,</hi> is that which encourages the Church to admit ſuch a perſon: And what is this but competent knowledge and piety viſible? This is evident in the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> who ſtood upon their tryal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were made compleat Church-members; nor did the Jews eaſily admit any for Proſelytes, till upon good evidence of their faith and piety. This foundation then failing, Church-memberſhip <hi>de jure</hi> muſt needs ceaſe; and this is the very caſe of groſly ignorant and ſcandalous perſons, who therefore being not Church-members <hi>de jure</hi> (at leaſt, if they obſtinately perſiſt in thoſe ſins) ought not to be admitted to the Sacrament.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. By conceſſion of the firſt branch, the confirming virtue of the Sacramental elements depends upon divine inſtitution: but have they a confirming vertue onely as received? Do not the elements ſet apart by the Miniſter, in the name of Chriſt, ſignifie and ſeal that branch of the Covenant, that Chriſt from eternity was ſet apart by God the Father for mans redemption? Do not the elements broken and poured out, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and ſeal Chriſts Body broken, and his Blood ſhed to ratifie the Covenant?

therefore none but the regenerate may hear and pray. This is no conſequence; for whatſoever ordinance can confirm faith, may beget it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt Branch I anſwer, by denying that Baptiſm confirms the faith onely of them that underſtand it. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Baptiſm may confirm the habit of faith in Infants regenerated before Baptiſm, though it cannot confirm the act of faith, which they are not capable of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may confirm as an inſtrument, though it cannot confirm faith in them as a ſign or ſeal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Baptiſm applyed to Infants may confirm faith in the ſame perſons when they come to years of diſcretion, though in their Infancy it ſhould not confirm: and therefore it is not to be denyed to Infants. If perſons Baptized in Infancy, could never be capable of the confirming power of Baptiſm, then the argument were ſtrong, that they ſhould not be Baptized.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond I anſwer, If the word and prayer did <hi>onely</hi> confirm faith, then the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence had been ſolid: but ſuch is the condition of the Sacrament.</p>

I pray upon what condition doth the Sacrament ſeal mercy to faith? Is not faith here the very act of beleeving? And doth the Sacrament ſeal grace to beleeving upon condition of beleeving? True, it ſeals mercy to a perſon upon condition of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; but to ſay it ſeals mercy to faith upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of faith, how abſurd? and all one as to ſay, it ſeals to the condition upon condition of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; would not here be <hi>progreſſus in infinitum?</hi>

He that kiſſes Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes him, hath more to anſwer for, than he who betrayes him without a kiſs. The higher profeſſion we make of love to Chriſt, the worſe is our ſin in murdering him; but he who receives, makes an higher profeſſion of love to Chriſt, than he who at preſent forbears, as fearing he doth not love Chriſt, and beleeve ſavingly in him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an unbeleeving receives, ſins more than an unbeleeving abſtainer; and here lyes the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs laid upon our conſciences, though Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is pleaſed to put it off lightly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, by conceſſion: Actual receiving ſerves to affect and oblige us more ſolemnly to the inward eating; whence it follows, that he who eats outwardly, but not inwardly, ſins more <hi>caeter is paribus,</hi> than he who eats neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly

nor outwardly, becauſe the former ſins againſt a greater obligation, as M. <hi>H.</hi> well notes; which therefore makes for us, and againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>H.</hi> ib. &amp; p. 186. M. <hi>D.</hi> is notable, <hi>The Sacrament he counts not a ſeal properly, but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively to the Covenant it ſelf.

Is not this pretty?

               <p n="1">1. Therefore note, That by <hi>proper</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer branch, I mean a <hi>litteral</hi> ſeal in the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſenſe, as is evident by my explication of my ſelf in the forequoted place, of purpoſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this captious miſtake, in theſe words, <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>In a</hi> proper <hi>ſenſe a ſeal is an artificial thing fit to make a viſible repreſentation or impreſſion.</hi>
                  </q> In this ſenſe, I ſay, the Sacrament is not <hi>properly</hi> a ſeal: For 1. It is not an artificial thing. 2. It makes not a viſible impreſſion either upon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or upon the receiver. Let me ask M. <hi>H.</hi> is the Sacrament a litteral ſeal? I have heard (in

this ſenſe) of a golden or ſilver ſeal, &amp;c. but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of a Breaden ſeal.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Proper,</hi> in the latter ſenſe, I mean a <hi>real</hi> ſeal, in oppoſition to a feigned and counterfeit ſeal, or the picture of a ſeal. This is known by the effects: hence we prove the Sun to be fire, becauſe it hath the effects of fire, though it differ much from our culinary fire. Now the main effect and uſe of a ſeal being to confirm and ratifie, and this being the proper effect of the Sacrament, we conclude, that the Sacrament is <hi>properly</hi> a ſeal, though it be not <hi>litterally</hi> a ſeal.</p>

As the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſo the Sacrament, is offered to all, if they will believe and repent; but unbelievers and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent perſons, muſt neither partake of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, nor of the ſeals.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his neceſſary conſequence is, a meer <hi>non ſequitur</hi> in both branches. True, the Covenant promiſes, the Sacrament ſeals, the ſeal ſecures grace abſolutely only to the <hi>Elect,</hi> and effectually called; <note place="margin">When I ſay initial grace is ſealed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>Elects</hi> I would not here be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: I do not mean, that initial grace is ſealed to an elect perſon (now in the ſtate of nature) as progreſſive grace is ſealed to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon effectually called. For illuſtration, Suppoſe <hi>Paul</hi> before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion receive the Sacrament, or be preſent at it, &amp;c. I do not think the Sacrament can aſſure <hi>Paul</hi> (though elected) that he ſhall be converted; but that it aſſures only in the general, that all the Elect ſhall be converted, who indeed are the <hi>Seed,</hi> and the true <hi>Iſrael. Rom</hi> 9. v.6, 7,8. compare <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. And this at preſent I cannot but aſſent to, till I be convineed, that the whole Covenant of grace is not ſealed or confirmed in the Lords Supper, which in its very inſtitution, was a ſign and ſeal of Chriſts blood ſhed not only for the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but alſo for <hi>many</hi> for the remiſſion of fins; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 28. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 20. And why that <hi>(many)</hi> ſhould not include all the Elect (as well as ſome of them) I know not, yet I will not be peremptory, but ſhall very willingly learn of Mr. H. or any other that will inform me better.</note> But how doth it thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that I muſt neceſſarily take upon me to judge who are Reprobates, or elſe all muſt be admitted? Mr. <hi>H.</hi> gives the reaſon, <hi>becauſe men may be
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:120105:175"/>
viſibly in the ſtate of nature, and yet elected.</hi> A pitiful reaſon, which I ſhall endeavour to evince by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Did I infallibly know a perſon to be elected, yea effectually called; It follows not that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt preſently admit him to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for he may be notwithſtanding actually unworthy, as lying under the guilt of ſome ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſin, &amp;c. much leſs then muſt all be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a ſuppoſition that poſſibly they are elected. Nor on the other hand doth it follow, That I undertake to judge who are Reprobates; For though it be true, that initial grace is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſealed, and ſecured in the Sacrament only to the elect; and though it be alſo true, that I dare not admit all Church-members to the Sacrament, yet it cannot flow from theſe two propoſitions, that I undertake to judge who are <hi>Reprobates,</hi> ſince we neither look at admiſſion of any, as an infallible evidence of their Election, nor at ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of any as an infallible evidence of their Reprobation; Nay we beleeve <hi>in theſi,</hi> that many perſons admitted are Reprobates, and that divers perſons ſuſpended are elect veſſels of mercy; the rule of Church-admiſſion being not electing grace, but viſible worthineſs, and the rule of Church-ſuſpenſion, being not Reprobation, but viſible unworthineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet further to convince him from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Covenant which he grants is ſealed in the Sacrament. It follows not, though the Covenant be ſealed conditionally to all Church-members, that therefore all Church-members muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or elſe I muſt take upon me to judge who are in the ſtate of nature, ſince the ground of
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:120105:175"/>
ſuſpenſion, is not ſimply mens being in the ſtate of nature, but their actual unworthineſs <hi>as viſible,</hi> whether they be in the ſtate of nature or not: Now if it follow not from the conditional ſealing of the Covenant in the Sacrament, that I muſt either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all, or undertake to judge who are in the ſtate of nature; why ſhould it follow from the abſolute ſealing of the Covenant, that all muſt be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or I undertake to judge who are Reprobates? And this is the more conſiderable, becauſe the conditional Covenant is ſealed to all, not ſo the abſolute Covenant. And if the conditional Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſealed to all be no ground for univerſal admiſſion, much leſs is the abſolute Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſealed only to ſome Church members, a ground why all Church-members ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>Again, if denying the Sacrament to divers to whom the Covenant is ſealed conditionally be no argument to prove that I judge them to be in the ſtate of nature, much leſs is the denying of the Sacrament to any an argument that I judge them to be Reprobates. My ſuſpenſion of any argues indeed that at preſent I judge ſuch a perſon to be viſibly unworthy, at leaſt actually; but it argues not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily that I judge him to be in the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, much leſs, that I judge him to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. ib. Had not the man ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned me, he might have found how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between what comes from Gods under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking with man, or the conditional boſome of the Covenant; and what comes from his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking with Chriſt, or the free, abſolute boſome of Election.</hi>

               <p>I ſhall therefore crave leave to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gods undertaking <hi>for</hi> man, and Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking <hi>with</hi> man. <hi>For</hi> man God undertook with Chriſt from eternity to call ſome effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality. With man God undertakes two wayes: 1. <hi>With all,</hi> at leaſt to whom the Covenant is proclaimed, to give them ſalvation by Chriſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of their faith and repentance. 2. <hi>With ſome</hi> (that is, the effectually called.) 1. To give them perſeverance in the condition which himſelf hath already wrought in them (partly of free grace, and partly by virtue of the Covenant made with Chriſt on their behalf.) And 2. In the iſſue to give them eternal ſalvation upon the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned account of Chriſt and free grace. And why Gods undertaking for man may not be ſealed in the Sacrament, as well as Gods undertaking with man; as yet I muſt confeſs, I ſee no convincing reaſon.</p>

progreſſive grace: <hi>and yet here,</hi> the Covenant <hi>(he counts)</hi> promiſes initial grace to the elect, and the ſeal ſecures what is in the Covenant. <hi>So that what need I to diſpute with Mr.</hi> Drake, <hi>when his own particulars have an opponent and defendant among themſelves? &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Q. 1. <hi>Whether it be one and the ſame Covenant I ſpeak of there?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to eternal Salvation, and the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conditions thereof (to wit, perſeverance and ſuitable growth in grace) I believe the Covenant made with Chriſt from eternity, and with thoſe of the elect, who are effectually called in time, is one and the ſame ſubſtantially, though in other particulars there be a vaſt difference.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>H.</hi> Q. 2. <hi>How the Covenant being conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, doth promiſe abſolutely?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe as it requires the condition of the regenerate, ſo it promiſes the condition to the regenerate.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>H.</hi> Q. 3. <hi>How it promiſes initial grace? For faith and repentance are the conditions of the Covenant; and how can faith be promiſed upon condition we have grace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That it doth promiſe initial grace, is evident by Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27. unleſs <hi>the new heart, the heart of fleſh, the ſpirit put within us,</hi> be not initial grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Initial faith and repentance are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, upon condition we have faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or grace (I own not that <hi>Brat,</hi> though M. <hi>H.</hi> would fain father it upon me) But becauſe its
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:120105:178"/>
promiſed or foretold <hi>abſolutely</hi> in the Covenant, that initial grace ſhall in due time be wrought in all the <hi>Elect</hi> yet uncalled (not ſo in the reprobate) And becauſe I apprehend the whole Covenant is ſealed or aſſured (as to its truth) in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I muſt confeſs (with ſubmiſſion to better judgements) I know not how to ſhut this branch of the Covenant here out of doors.</p>
               <p>Object. <note place="margin">This Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſuppoſes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſalvation made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally to natural men.</note> 
                  <hi>Is it not a mockage to make a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional promiſe to him, who I know cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the condition?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not at all. Suppoſing 1. He be bound to the condition. 2. That the condition was once in his power. 3. That he loſt that power by his own default, which is the caſe of all <hi>Adams</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity by natural generation. Doth God mock natural men who are under the Law, by promiſing them life upon condition of perfect obedience? <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 17. Hath God loſt his authority to command, becauſe we have loſt our power to obey? And may not God annex a promiſe to any command, but he muſt be thought to mock his creature? And if God may promiſe life to perfect obedience, without mockage; may he not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe life to faith, without mockage, though the creature left to it ſelf be able to perform neither of the conditions? May the creditor promiſe liberty to an inſolvent debtor, upon condition he ſatisfie the debt, and that without mockage; and may not God promiſe life to an impotent creature, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition the creature believe, &amp;c. without mockage? God by requiring impoſſible condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and annexing promiſes to thoſe conditions, deſigns not to mock his poor creature, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the creatures impotency, and thereby to out it of ſelf, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As much difference as there is between the tender of 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> down upon the nail, and the promiſe of the ſaid money without tender. The tender of the money upon the day will excuſe the debtor in Law, not ſo the promiſe of that money. I think there is ſome difference between ſaying, <hi>Come when you will, and you ſhall have your money;</hi> and ſaying, <hi>Here is your money, I pray tell it and take it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Q. 5. <hi>How can the offer of grace. be ſaid to be ſealed, as offer is diſtinguiſhed from promiſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As he that tenders money promiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand and ſeal, may by witneſs, hand and ſeal, atteſt that the tender was made to all, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by ſome creditors, but refuſed by others. I hope here the tender ſealed, is diſtinguiſhed clear enough from the promiſe ſealed.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Q. 6. <hi>Whether the Miniſter can ſeal which he pleaſe, either the offer or promiſe; and why he ſhonld not content himſelf to ſeal the offer which is ſure to all preſent, rather than to ſeal the promiſe where he may erre, ſeeing his viſible Legatees, really may not be ſuch?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Miniſter muſt ſeal what Chriſt would have him, and that is both offer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, they ever going together in the Sacrament; nor is he at his own choice, to ſeal whether he pleaſe. What God promiſes in the Covenant, that he offers by his Ambaſſadors, both in the word preached, and at the Sacrament; onely at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:120105:179"/>
there is not onely a promiſe and offer, but alſo a ſealing of them both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The promiſe and offer are conſiderable, 1. As to their real exiſtence; and thus the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeals, that the <hi>promiſe</hi> and <hi>offer</hi> of Chriſt to all preſent (yea, wherever the Goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) conditionally, is no fiction, but a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental truth. 2. As to its attingency and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and thus its not <hi>promiſed</hi> or <hi>offered</hi> to all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or to all receivers. My meaning is, that at the Sacrament, Chriſt with all his benefits is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo either <hi>promiſed</hi> or <hi>offered,</hi> as that all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are aſſured thereby, they ſhall either obtain infallibly the good things promiſed, or accept the good things tendered. Whence it follows, that though the Miniſter may miſtake (as a man) about the perſon of any receiver, thinking chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably he hath grace, when he hath it not: yet he cannot miſtake as to his office, ſince he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes not to promiſe or tender Chriſt effectually to any (that being onely Gods work) though he groundedly hope God by him doth effectually promiſe and tender Chriſt to divers receivers; namely, where the Spirit is pleaſed to ſtrike in effectually with the promiſe and tender ſealed, in the Sacrament, by the Miniſter as Chriſts Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>How can the Miniſter ſeal abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the regenerate, when he cannot ſeal to them but upon condition of regeneration? And ſince he knows none that are regenerated (I mean, as ſuch) must he not needs ſeal conditionally to all, and ſo to the regenerate among the reſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As a promiſe may be both abſolute and conditional, ſo it may be ſealed both abſolutely
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:120105:179"/>
and conditionally: Now the promiſe is made to the regenerate both abſolutely and conditionally; therefore it may and muſt be ſealed to them both abſolutely and conditionally. The promiſe of ſalvation is made and ſealed to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, that is, upon condition of his acting and perſevering in faith, &amp;c. 2. Abſolutely, becauſe really the condition is and ſhall be performed by him. The ſame promiſe is made and ſealed to <hi>Judas onely</hi> conditionally, becauſe thoſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are neither performed nor performable by him: whence the promiſe can no way be made or ſealed <hi>abſolutely</hi> to <hi>Judas,</hi> as it is to <hi>Timothy.</hi> Though therefore the Miniſter at the Sacrament ſeal <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> yet at the ſame time he ſeals <hi>abſolutely</hi> alſo (though haply unwittingly) becauſe the condition of eternal ſalvation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by <hi>Timothy,</hi> not ſo by <hi>Judas.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I perceive M. <hi>H.</hi> hath a ſtrong breath, to blaſt a mans ſenſe, where he cannot convince it. I dare not boaſt of any worthineſs either in my perſon, words, or actions; I hope the Lord hath made me truly ſenſible of my exceeding great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs in them all. However (as I have) I ſhall endeavor, through grace, to aſſert and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate truth, though, I muſt confeſs, too unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily. As to the point in hand:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Its falſe, that Chriſt is or muſt be held forth to all preſent <hi>Sacramentally,</hi> if by holding forth you mean an offer or tender. Suppoſe one <hi>jure</hi> excommunicate be preſent; muſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter offer Chriſt <hi>Sacramental</hi> to him? M. <hi>H.</hi> himſelf hath granted the contrary. True, he is held forth to all preſent Sacramentally by way of <hi>Declaration,</hi> but not by way of <hi>Oblation</hi> or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to all preſent. All preſent may ſee Chriſt ſet apart and broken Sacramentally, &amp;c. they may alſo ſee the Covenant ſealed in the Sacrament to all preſent conditionally: But it follows not thence, that Chriſt muſt needs be offered Sacramentally to all preſent, though he be always offered to ſome preſent Sacramentally, and muſt be ſo received by them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its falſe, that unleſs the Sacramental bread be eaten (underſtand proportionably of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Cup as Chriſts blood) its not Chriſts body: for 1. Its Chriſts body by conſecration, according to Chriſts inſtitution, before it be taken and eaten, otherwiſe the Miniſter would utter an untruth in ſpeaking thoſe words, <hi>Take eat, this is Chriſts body, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The not receiving of ſome preſent (whether it be orderly or ſinful) cannot make void Chriſts inſtitution, but by vertue thereof the bread
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:120105:180"/>
is Chriſts body, ſo long as the ſolemnity of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament continues.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though Chriſt be not offered <hi>Sacrament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally</hi> to all at the Lords Supper, yet he is offered <hi>Spiritually</hi> to all preſent, and the promiſe of Chriſt ſpiritual is ſealed conditionally to all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; who ſeeing Chriſt crucified by them, and for them, may be much affected and wrought upon, though they do not receive the Elements, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. as well as the Communicants themſelves, who I hope, are affected with the Elements ſet apart, broken and poured out, before their actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. May not a <hi>Look</hi> upon Chriſt crucified, affect <hi>as well</hi> as a <hi>receiving</hi> of Chriſt crucified? <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. I do not ſay <hi>as much,</hi> ſince both of theſe actions will affect more then one of them.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>H. p.</hi> 191. <hi>As the Miniſter doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looſe, but binde in the word; ſo doth he in the Sacrament, but conditionally in both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If his meaning be, that the Miniſter looſes and bindes <hi>onely</hi> conditionally, then he looſes the wicked as much as the godly, and bindes the godly as much as the wicked; the reaſon is, becauſe at the ſame time that he looſes the godly conditionally, he bindes them alſo conditionally; and at the ſame time he bindes the wicked condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, he looſes them alſo conditionally. Dare he ſay abſolutely to a godly man; <hi>Thy ſins are remitted, though thou repent not;</hi> or to a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, <hi>Thy ſins are bound, though thou repent?</hi> I pray what difference between <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> as to this particular, upon M. <hi>H.</hi> his principles. <hi>Timothies</hi> ſins are looſed if he repent, and bound if he repent not; <hi>Judas</hi> his ſins are
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:120105:181"/>
bound if he repent not, and looſed if he repent. Is it not evident here, that <hi>Judas</hi> is looſed as much as <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> bound as much as <hi>Judas,</hi> if the binding or looſing be onely condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional on both ſides. Therefore ſay we, the Miniſter looſes the wicked conditionally, when he bindes the wicked abſolutely; he looſes the godly abſolutely, when he bindes them conditionally: yea, when he looſe the godly conditionally, he looſes them abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely; and when he bindes the wicked conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he bindes them abſolutely; and that becauſe the conditions upon which the firſt is looſed, and the ſecond bound, are <hi>in</hi> them abſolutely, or are performed <hi>by</hi> them. And a conditional looſing or binding, where the condition is performed, is abſolute, as before. The Miniſter acting <hi>clave non errante,</hi> bindes the wicked abſolutely, as to his preſent ſtate, but looſes the godly abſolutely both as to his preſent and future-ſtate, becauſe the godly hath performed the condition of looſing, and ſhall certainly perſevere in the performance of that condition; but many wicked men do not perſevere in the condition of binding (namely, unbelief and impenitency) therefore the Miniſter cannot binde them abſolutely for the future. Now as the Miniſter looſes and bindes, not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, but alſo abſolutely in the word, ſo he doth in the Sacrament: And ſo he ſeals my looſing or binding, whether I receive or not, ſince the Sacrament ſeals the whole Covenant of Grace made with man, whereof <hi>looſing</hi> and <hi>binding</hi> are a great part. Nor is it material the Miniſter ſhould know (as ſuch) the perſons whom he bindes or looſes abſolutely, the binding or looſing being as ſure and effectual, though he do
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:120105:181"/>
it <hi>ignorans,</hi> as though he did it <hi>ſciens volens.</hi> Only the Miniſter muſt take heed he loſe not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſtorally or juridically where he thinks in his conſcience he ought to bind; nor bind where his conſcience tells him he ought to looſe, whether it be with the key of Doctrine, or of Diſcipline.</p>

My argument is drawn from the general, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular promiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. and confirmed from the particular offer of grace, and from the argument <hi>à genere ad ſpeciem.</hi> See p. 141. and 142. of my <hi>Bar.</hi> Now what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the Covenant is ſealed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. denies my argument,</hi> and gives his reaſon, <hi>page</hi> 193. <hi>becauſe the Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes only conditionally that I ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It hath been formerly ſhewed, that what is promiſed conditionally, is promiſed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, where the condition is performed; and what is promiſed in the Covenant, is ſealed in the Sacrament. As in this conditional propoſition, <hi>If</hi> Mr. <hi>H. be a man, he is a living creature.</hi> I hope the conditionality of this propoſition is no bar to the abſoluteneſs of the conſequent. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is conditionally an <hi>animal,</hi> as is evident in the hypotheſis, yet he is abſolutely an <hi>animal</hi> too. Why? becauſe the condition of animality (namely humanity) is in him.</p>
               <p>In like manner, <hi>If</hi> Timothy <hi>beleeve, he ſhall be ſaved;</hi> the conſequent (Timothy <hi>ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>) is abſolute in ſenſe, becauſe he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the condition of faith, though it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional in terms: And that promiſe which ſayes, All that beleeve ſhall be ſaved, ſayes <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhall be ſaved, becauſe <hi>Timothy</hi> beleeves; as he that ſayes, All men ſhall riſe, ſayes <hi>Timothy</hi> ſhall
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:120105:184"/>
riſe, becauſe <hi>Timothy</hi> is a man.</p>
               <p>Note by the way, that I do not ſay, The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is abſolute <hi>to all,</hi> but only to thoſe who have performed, or have in them the condition; and withall, that though it be true, that he who once receives with faith ſhall be ſaved, <hi>yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not, that he who once receives without faith ſhall be damned,</hi> as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> abſurdly infers, <hi>page</hi> 194. ſince even a ſtate of unbeleef doth not prove abſolutely that I ſhall be damned, but only that at preſent I am in a ſtate of damnation; much leſs doth a receiving once without faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any ſuch direful concluſion; and the reaſon is, becauſe a ſtate of unbeleef is changeable through grace, but a ſtate of faith is unchangeable through grace; and one act of faith, argues a ſtate of faith, but one omiſſion of the act of faith, doth not argue a ſtate of unbeleef.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ib.</hi> His argument is too weak to convince my diſtinction of weakneſs, for though the matter of the offer and promiſe be all one, yet that grace may be offered abſolutely which is not accepted, but no grace is promiſed abſolutely, which is not, or ſhall not be accepted.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ib. <hi>I deny it; what is but upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is not abſolute; you may ſay, It is as good to me, as if it were abſolute; it is certain, (there lyes the equivocation) but how is it certain? not abſolutely certain (as election is) but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally certain; for the promiſe is ſtill the ſame, and no new promiſe.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If a conditional promiſe be <hi>as good to me,</hi> as if it were abſolute; that is, <hi>certain,</hi> then
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:120105:184"/>
M. <hi>H.</hi> doth but wrangle about terms. Grant the Believers ſalvation is certain, as if it were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, we have enough: And its evident, there is a wide difference between the conditionality of <hi>Peters</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> his ſalvation, ſince <hi>Peters</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſalvation is certain, not ſo <hi>Judas</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſalvation. That which is abſolute can but be certain, and that which is conditional is certain. Now that which is certain in the Covenant, is ſealed in the Sacrament; therefore its ſealed in the Sacrament that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall certainly be ſaved (not ſo that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhall certainly be ſaved) which is the concluſion of the Syllogiſm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no equivocation, but a plain and downright aſſertion, <hi>That conditionality is no Bar to abſoluteneſs:</hi> And, if this be not true, there is no abſolute propoſition in the world. To inſtance in that of election, which M. <hi>H.</hi> grants is abſolute. Let the propoſition be, <hi>All that are elected, ſhall certainly be ſaved.</hi> This propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in truth is abſolute, and is ſo granted to be by M. <hi>H.</hi> Now let M. <hi>H.</hi> or any other, prove this propoſition; he will clearly ſee, it is condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional alſo. For evidence whereof, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this Agument,

                     <hi>If God be all-wiſe, all-ſufficient, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in his eternal purpoſe of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, then all that are elected ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaved. But God is ſo;</hi> ergo.</q>
Is it not here evident, that the conſequent (which is the concluſion) is conditional? yet withal, we ſay truly, it is abſolute. Why? Becauſe the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of infinite wiſdom, power, and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs (which are the neceſſary <hi>mediums</hi> to prove the concluſion) are really, neceſſarily, and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

Obſerve now how the argument and anſwer run parallel with my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to prove I believe, and M. <hi>H.</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer applyed thereto; by which compariſon the abſurdity of M. <hi>H.</hi> his anſwer will evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.

Timothy <hi>have theſe marks, he hath ſaving faith;</hi> yet the conſequent is abſolute, becauſe the condition is performed in <hi>Timothy.</hi> And it is as abſurd to argue, I but <hi>the eſſential marks of faith are the ſame with faith; and therefore cannot prove believing to be faith:</hi> as to argue, <hi>The eſſential marks of a man are the ſame with a man; and therefore cannot prove</hi> Timothy <hi>to be a man.</hi>

               <p>Yet further to evidence the abſurdity, let us argue proportionably about the <hi>Command,</hi> as we have done about the <hi>Promiſe.</hi> I ask Mr. <hi>H.</hi> then, Whether the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth not ſay, I <hi>Roger</hi> muſt not commit adultery.

The <hi>minor</hi> of the <hi>Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meme, I Roger am a man,</hi> is thus proved, He that hath the neceſſary marks of a man, is a man; I have theſe marks, therefore I am a man.</p>

Yea by ſuch a looſe argument might not all obedience be waved, as alſo the eſpecial commands of the Goſpel? If the Word and Covenant do not aſſure me that I muſt repent, then it cannot be proved from Scripture that I muſt repent. But this the word doth not aſſure me, <hi>ergo.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is proved, becauſe
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:120105:190"/>
the <hi>Scripture</hi> no where ſayes, <hi>Then</hi> Roger <hi>muſt repent; ergo.</hi> How will Mr. <hi>H.</hi> now convince me but by arguing thus? The <hi>Scripture</hi> ſayes, Every <hi>man</hi> muſt repent, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30. Thou <hi>Roger</hi> art a <hi>man, ergo;</hi> ſuppoſe now I ſhould return, the Scripture no where ſayes, <hi>Thou</hi> Roger <hi>art a man, or haſt the marks of a man</hi> (underſtand the ſame of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi>) therefore it cannot be proved that I am a man, and by conſequence, that I am commanded in <hi>Scripture</hi> to repent. Would not ſuch a reply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Cudgel rather than an anſwer? Its evident then that the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth by conſequence (though not in expreſs terms) aſſure <hi>Timothy That he doth beleeve,</hi> which is the <hi>minor</hi> of the ſyllogiſm of aſſurance: And what the Covenant aſſures, that the Sacrament ſeals, namely, That <hi>Timothy doth beleeve, &amp;c.</hi>

Scriptures quoted by Mr.</hi> H.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Very eaſily, thus: Faith and ſenſe are not always oppoſite in order to the object, but in order to the maner of apprehending the object. Both faith and ſenſe may at the ſame time apprehend the ſame object, but not in the ſame maner. Thus faith aſſents to Chriſts reſurrection as a thing revealed by divine teſtimony; ſenſe aſſents to it as a thing ſeen and felt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 27, 29. Faith aſſents not properly upon the principles of ſenſe, nor doth ſenſe aſſent upon the principles of faith. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of faith is a thing not ſeen, the proper object of ſenſe is a thing ſeen; and the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in one ſenſe is conſiderable as not ſeen, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe as ſeen. Thus heathen <hi>by ſenſe</hi> aſſent to a Deity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. Chriſtians both by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>ſenſe;</hi> whence the Deity is ſaid to be both vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and inviſible in the fore-quoted place, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 27. inviſible to ſenſe, viſible to faith; inviſible in its eſſence, viſible in its effects. Its evident then that in ſome reſpects ſenſe doth not take away faith, and that therefore this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>I beleeve,</hi> may be an object both of faith and ſenſe. It depends upon faith in order to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by <hi>Scripture</hi> ſigns, it depends upon ſenſe in order to experience by an act of reflexion. Thus the <hi>major</hi> in the ſyllogiſm of aſſurance depends purely upon faith, the <hi>minor</hi> partly upon faith, partly upon ſenſe. The Concluſion flows neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily from both. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his illuſtration if rightly ſtated will favour us, in order whereunto I ſhall reduce Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his <hi>Theſis</hi> to an <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> Thus, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2.

How is <hi>Rahab</hi> now aſſured of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation? <hi>Anſ.</hi> By being aſſured of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant friendſhip. How is ſhe aſſured of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant friendſhip? <hi>Anſ.</hi> By the ſure marks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of given by the Spies; namely, if ſhe continued to keep their counſel, and to keep them ſafe from the King of <hi>Jerico</hi> his danger, &amp;c. Is it not here then true, that the evidence of her friendſhip to the Spies, depended upon an act of humane faith, <hi>That the forementioned hiding of the Spies, &amp;c. were ſure ſigns of her friendſhip;</hi> and partly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on experience, by reflection that ſhe had theſe ſigns. In like manner in the ſpiritual treaty, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> is aſſured of his ſalvation, by being aſſured of his faith. He is aſſured of his faith, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſigns thereof held forth in the Covenant. Suppoſe (which is M. <hi>H.</hi> his illuſtration) Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are granted and ſealed to a Town, upon ſuch and ſuch <hi>qualifications;</hi> here it concerns me (if a Townſman) to evidence that I have the right qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications. For evidence hereof, I muſt appeal, not onely to witneſſes, but alſo to the Covenant of Articles, where there is any controverſie about the rectitude of my qualifications; elſe might not the <hi>General</hi> ſay? Friend, you bring witneſs of ſuch and ſuch qualifications, but you are miſtaken in the manner of them, or in ſome neceſſary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance about them? muſt not I now appeal to the Covenant of Articles to make out that the qualification thus evidenced, is right for manner, and all requiſite circumſtances? And doth not my evidence then depend partly upon my witneſſes, and partly upon the Covenant? Now in proving the <hi>minor, That I believe,</hi> it ſeldom falls out, but there is ſome diſpute within me againſt this
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:120105:191"/>
act of evidence, which may ariſe from temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without, from the oppoſite corruption within, and from the weakneſs of my faith, &amp;c. upon which account, I muſt to the Covenant for the clearing of thoſe objections and exceptions. And otherwiſe, why do Miniſters take ſo much pains in laying down tryals, ſigns and evidences of faith, and other graces, but to help my faith of evidence, which is the <hi>minor</hi> of the Syllogiſm of aſſurance? A godly man will eaſily aſſent to the <hi>major, That all who believe, are justified by Chriſt,</hi> this being expreſs Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 39, but the difficulty is to bring him to ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, <hi>I believe,</hi> which is the <hi>minor</hi> of the <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> of aſſurance. Now to produce this aſſent, you muſt clear it by <hi>Scripture</hi>-evidence, that his act of adherence is conformable to the rule of the covenant. In order whereunto two things are neceſſary, 1. An aſſent by reflexion, that I have produced an elicite act of adherence upon Chriſt. 2. An aſſent of faith in my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this act of adherence is not an act of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but a regular adherence, according to the minde of the Covenant. Both theſe concur to make out the <hi>minor,</hi> which therefore depends partly upon faith, and partly upon inward ſenſe and experience. Now ſo far as my faith of evidence depends upon <hi>Scripture,</hi> ſo far its evidenced by the Covenant, and ſealed in the Sacrament, which is all I drive at.

               <p>Now <hi>contrà,</hi> If I may prove a thing by it ſelf, then I may prove a man by the marks of a man, which (if eſſential, <hi>&amp; à priori</hi>) are himſelf; I may prove faith by the marks of faith, which (if eſſential, <hi>&amp; à priori</hi>) are faith it ſelf: And ſuch is that mark of <hi>receiving Chriſt for righteouſneſs.</hi> Nor is there any abſurdity in it, ſo the Argument proving be not both <hi>re</hi> and <hi>ratione,</hi> the ſame with the thing proved. <note place="margin">Thus the <hi>Whole</hi> or <hi>totum</hi> is defined or deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by all its parts; all which together differ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Scripture by conſequence or not?

So likewiſe that <hi>John</hi> the receiver of Chriſt is a beleever, as that <hi>John</hi> the reaſonable creature is a man. I grant for the moſt part it is not ſo evident that <hi>John</hi> is a beleever, as that he is a man; and that therefore it is not ſo eaſie for him to beleeve that he ſhall be ſaved, as to beleeve that he ſhall riſe; but ſtill its a truth, That both theſe Concluſions flow from Scripture by conſequence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are in Scripture by conſequence, which is the thing here oppoſed by Mr. <hi>Humphrey.</hi> He might therefore well have ſpared himſelf the labour of his merry <hi>Tautologies (he that is in the right, is in the right, &amp;c.)</hi> but that he hoped to catch his Reader by a frothy expreſſion, rather than to convince him by a ſolid Argument.

                  <hi>Page</hi> 198.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ib.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> grants, <hi>That a general faith and acknowledgement of the Goſpel, or Covenant of Jeſus Chriſt, as the only means to be ſaved by, is prerequiſive to adult Church-memberſhip, and ſo to the Sacraments.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I am glad of any agreement between us in this unhappy controverſie, eſpecially in a point
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:120105:199"/>
of this nature, which tends ſo much to the bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of bruiſed reeds. Yet</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is ſome ambiguity in that expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of M. <hi>H. If a man may come as loſt;</hi> nor are they my expreſs terms, <hi>p.</hi> 148. of my <hi>Bar.</hi> A man is loſt three ways, 1. <hi>Really,</hi> when in the ſtate of nature (I mean, he is in a loſt condition.) 2. <hi>Senſibly,</hi> and that either <hi>in himſelf</hi> (and thus we muſt ever be loſt, if we mean to be ſaved) or by miſtake, thinking he is in the ſtate of nature, at that very time when in truth he is in the ſtate of grace. 3. <hi>Both ways,</hi> when clearly convinced by the Spirit of bondage, that he is in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eſtate, and ſo under the work of Legal humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, which is ever accompanied with reigning pride, till evangelical humiliation melt the rock, and level the mountain. By legal humiliation a perſon is <hi>humbled,</hi> but by Evangelical humiliation he is made <hi>humble;</hi> by legal humiliation God humbles him, by evangelical humiliation he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himſelf; the one is humbled paſſively, the other actively.</p>
               <p>To apply the diſtinction:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that is loſt <hi>really,</hi> and <hi>ſenſibly,</hi> ought at preſent to abſtain: Such are they, who know themſelves to be in the ſtate of nature, and have no reſolution at the preſent to come up to the terms of the Goſpel, but are under the Regal power of ſin, eſpecially of ſome boſom corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that ſenſibly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that is loſt really, but not ſenſibly, as thinking himſelf converted, when unconverted, is (I conceive, with ſubmiſſion to better judgements) in the condition of one who thinks a ſin to be a duty, <hi>ligatus,</hi> but not <hi>obligatus, bound,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:120105:200"/>
miſinformed, to receive; but not obliged to receive; yea, obliged by the precept, to abſtain: or as he who thought himſelf clean, but was unclean, was bound and obliged in order to the Paſſover.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He that is ſenſibly loſt (as thinking himſelf unconverted, when really converted) ſeems <hi>bound</hi> by conſcience to abſtain, but is <hi>obliged</hi> by the command to receive; and in order thereunto, muſt endeavor to get his doubts ſatisfied. He that is both really and ſenſibly <hi>found,</hi> as having <hi>ſenſibly</hi> evangelical preparation (of which ſelf-loſs, and ſelf-unworthineſs in a Goſpel ſenſe, is a chief part) is both <hi>bound</hi> and <hi>obliged</hi> to come, unleſs detained by a juſt occaſion.</p>
               <p>What M. <hi>H.</hi> addes <hi>page</hi> 201. I ſhall go along with him as far as I can, and be glad of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany too. And therefore grant 1. That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a ſeal of faith <hi>Conſecutivè.</hi> 2. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectivè.</hi> 3. <hi>Conditionaliter.</hi> 4. <hi>Obligatoriè,</hi> as obliging the receiver to believe. 5. That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is not properly a ſeal of reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; and therefore in a ſtrict ſenſe, doth not ſeal the Concluſion, as it depends upon the <hi>minor,</hi> which ſpeaks experience; but as it depends upon the <hi>major,</hi> which ſpeaks expreſs Scripture.</p>
               <p>But whereas he addes, <hi>ibid. But if you ſay it is a ſeal of faith ſubjectivè, properly to confirm and ratifie faith, or any way ſo to aſſure or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence faith, that God ſhall be made to ſet his ſeal to a lye, if any come without ſaving faith, this muſt be denied and rejected, and anſwered, that the Sacrament is not thus a ſeal of faith (to wit, formally, directly, properly) but of the Covenant, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If I may but crave to be candidly underſtood, its no ſuch monſter as M. <hi>H.</hi> would make it, to aſſert, That the Sacrament is a ſeal of faith <hi>ſubjectivè;</hi> namely, that by <hi>Conſequence</hi> the Sacrament ſeals to <hi>Peter,</hi> that he believes. The reaſon whereof hath formerly been given, becauſe it ſeals the <hi>major</hi> propoſition, upon which the Concluſion of Aſſurance doth partly depend. For, as no Concluſion depends onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>major,</hi> or onely upon the <hi>minor,</hi> but upon both premiſes; ſo the Concluſion of the Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllogiſm (<hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>believes</hi>) depends not <hi>ſolely</hi> upon the <hi>major (He that receives Chriſt, &amp;c. believes)</hi> nor <hi>ſolely</hi> upon the <hi>minor</hi> (Peter <hi>receives Chriſt</hi>) but upon both. And therefore ſo far forth as this Concluſion (Peter <hi>believes</hi>) depends upon the <hi>major</hi> (which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Scripture, and as a ſign diſcovers to <hi>Peter,</hi> that the act of adherence he produces is not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit) ſo far forth its ſealed in the Sacrament, it being ſealed in the Covenant onely as it is in the Covenant; namely, by Conſequence; as is that Concluſion, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>ſhall riſe,</hi> which depends upon the <hi>major, That all men ſhall riſe;</hi> as well as upon the <hi>minor, That</hi> Peter <hi>is a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas M. <hi>H.</hi> hints, that by this means <hi>God ſhall be made to ſet his ſeal to a lye, if any come without ſaving faith:</hi> this is a moſt falſe, groſs, and uncharitable inference and imputation, it being far from my judgement or argument to hold forth, that the Sacrament ſeals to all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, that they have true faith; but onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe who have ſaving faith indeed. Suppoſe now <hi>Judas</hi> did receive; the Sacrament which ſeals to <hi>Peter that he believes,</hi> ſeals no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:120105:201"/>
to <hi>Judas,</hi> but the quite contrary, namely, <hi>That he doth not believe;</hi> and that becauſe it ſeals, That he who doth not receive. Chriſt rightly, doth not believe: But <hi>Judas</hi> never received Chriſt rightly; therefore by conſequence it ſeals to <hi>Judas</hi> his unbelief, and ſo his damnation <hi>in ſtatu quo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore, If by <hi>formally, directly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,</hi> M. <hi>H.</hi> mean <hi>expreſly,</hi> we grant the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not ſo a ſeal of faith <hi>ſubjectivè;</hi> for it can ſeal nothing thus expreſly, but what is in expreſs terms in the Covenant, and that is onely the <hi>major:</hi> yet this is no bar, but that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament may ſeal that conſequentially, which is conſequentially in the Covenant; and ſuch is this Concluſion, <hi>Peter believes,</hi> as well as that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>Peter ſhall riſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for his vapor therefore in the cloſe of this Section, I ſhall ſay but onely this to it, However <hi>my arguments be but earthen ware,</hi> yet God can uſe them to break his conceited bar of iron.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To ſhew the fallacy, let us put the ſame caſe about the Paſſover, and the receivers thereof: thus,</p>
               <p>"<hi>The Paſſover belongs conditionally to all Iſraelites, but abſolutely to the clean Iſraelite.</hi> Suppoſe now Mr. <hi>H.</hi> reply as above, <hi>mutatis mutandis.</hi>

                  <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>If there be any ſenſe and validity in this, he muſt argue thus, The Paſſover is not to be</hi> delivered <hi>to all it belongs to conditionally, but to thoſe onely to whom it belongs abſolutely; But it belongs onely to the clean Iſraelites ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely; therefore it muſt be</hi> delivered <hi>onely to the clean Iſraelites abſolutely: Now this, you ſee, is apparently falſe, ſeeing he admits ſome onely viſibly clean, to whom himſelf counts the Paſſover belongs not abſolutely.</hi>
                  </q> Is
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:120105:202"/>
not the firſt branch now evidently falſe? namely. <hi>That the Paſſeover is to be delivered onely to thoſe to whom it belongs abſolutely.</hi> I hope the Prieſt or Maſter of the Family might, and ought to admit all perſons viſibly clean to eat the Paſſover, when at the ſame time he that was viſibly clean, but really unclean (to whom therefore the Paſſover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed conditionally, but not abſolutely) ſinned in receiving the Paſſover.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it not a meer <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> as to the Objection, which mentions not to whom the Paſſcover is to be <hi>delivered,</hi> or not, but onely to whom it <hi>belongs,</hi> or doth not <hi>belong?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Apply now the ſame anſwer to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and it will appear my ſenſe is good and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid; and that I do not argue, as M. <hi>H.</hi> would make the Reader believe I do, who to make my ſenſe abſurd, ſhuffles into his own anſwer the term <hi>delivered,</hi> in ſtead of the term <hi>receiving.</hi> Let my anſwer run thus, The Sacrament is not to be <hi>received</hi> by all to whom it belongs condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, but onely by thoſe to whom it belongs abſolutely: But it belongs abſolutely onely to the worthy receiver; therefore it is to be <hi>received</hi> onely by the worthy receiver.</p>
               <p>Where is now M. <hi>H.</hi> his abſurd Concluſion, Therefore it muſt be <hi>delivered</hi> onely to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiver?</p>
               <p>The Miniſter, I hope, may, and in ſome caſes ought to <hi>deliver</hi> it to them, who at the ſame time ought not to <hi>receive</hi> it, he acting (as Chriſts Officer) by the rule of viſible, not of real wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, and ſo regularly admitting thoſe to whom it belongs viſibly, though at the ſame time it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to them abſolutely.

The ſecond muſt be <hi>admitted,</hi> but if onely viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Saints, ought not to <hi>receive.</hi> The third muſt both be <hi>admitted,</hi> and ought to <hi>receive,</hi> unleſs detained by a juſt occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 203. M. <hi>H.</hi> charges me with railing, for ſhewing him the horrid concluſion that follows from his looſe principles; namely, <hi>That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth more ingenuouſly belong to one out of Covenant, than to one in Covenant:</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 51. of his vindication. Which if true, it muſt more ingenuouſly belong to Drunkards, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, Murderers, &amp;c. than to real and viſible Saints, the former being out of Covenant, the latter in Covenant. An inference ſo monſtrous, that I apprehended ſuch a ſoar and ulcer required a ſharp knife to open it; yet withal, I told the Reader what M. <hi>H.</hi> his meaning ſhould be, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Sacrament belongs more ingenuouſly to weak Saints, than to ſtrong Saints. An Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, &amp;c. reſolving ſincerely to believe and repent, hath already begun to do both; and ſo is not out of Covenant, but a weak Saint. This was my ſcope, and is the ſame ſtill, though I will not juſtifie every quick expreſſion that either there or elſewhere paſſed from me.</p>
               <p>What he cites from my text elſwhere, to ſalve his contradiction, wil do himlittle ſervice; ſince I charge him not with abſurdity for ſaying, a man may have a good reſolution before he is in Covenant;
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:120105:203"/>
but for ſaying, <hi>The Sacrament be longs more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly to one out of Covenant,</hi> if he have ſome good reſolutions for kinde, through fear of Hell, &amp;c. (which are but legal or meer velleities) then to a real and viſible Saint, who comes fully up to Chriſts terms in point of ſincerity, but acts weakly, as a Babe in Chriſt. That a man may not onely reſolve well, but alſo enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and yet his heart be naught, I never queſtioned; <hi>or that he may have good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions before be believe, or enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſincerely,</hi> as M. <hi>H.</hi> notes, <hi>p.</hi> 204. But what is this to M. <hi>H.</hi> his purpoſe? or how doth it follow (what he charges me <hi>ib.</hi>) that I am too narrow in ſpeaking of theſe things, unleſs becauſe I cannot extend my ſelf to his latitude? If ſtudy of brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore paſſing by thoſe things which are well known, and not to our preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, be narrowneſs of expreſſion, I muſt confeſs I affect ſuch narrowneſs, and wiſh I were better at it than I am: But M. <hi>H.</hi> his clouding and jumbling things together, forces me to be larger than otherwiſe I would; yea, withal, I muſt confeſs, I am always too narrow in diſcourſing of the things of God, which are far above my weak comprehenſion, much more above my poor expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. This ever is the glory of divine Truth, That the apprehenſions and expreſſions of the ableſt, are but cockle-ſhels to its Oceans, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 96. and mine are but cockle-ſhels to the flood of their appehenſions and expreſſions.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">
                     <hi>Had he now ſaid, That the benefits of the Covenant do not belong to him, as to right or fruition, till he be in Covenant: but the condition of the Covenant belongs to all by way of obligation, and the benefits of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant belong to all by way of tender, &amp;c.

               <p>He that divides the whole into parts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gives the name of the whole to one of thoſe parts, ſpeaks neither Logically, nor clearly. But this doth M. <hi>H.</hi> by diſtinguiſhing the Covenant into its <hi>condition,</hi> and its <hi>benefits;</hi> and then ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Covenant is of epidemical concernment as
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:120105:204"/>
to its tender (he ſuppoſing and holding, that the <hi>conditions</hi> are required, not tendered, and that onely the benefits are tendered conditionally to all) here the <hi>Covenant</hi> is the <hi>totum,</hi> the <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>benefits</hi> are the <hi>partes;</hi> which laſt <hi>part</hi> (in applying his diſtinction) he preſents under the notion of the whole, and thereby makes his ſenſe obſcure and ſubject to exceptions.

And though it be a truth, that the benefits of the Covenant are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to all upon condition of faith, yet becauſe M. <hi>H.</hi> holds that faith is not tendered, but required, (in the revealed Covenant ſealed in the Sacrament, of which we now ſpeak) he cannot ſay the <hi>tenor</hi>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:120105:204"/>
(called by him the Covenant) is tendered to all, without contradicting himſelf; but muſt ſay, if he ſpeak uniformly to his own doctrine, that the <hi>tenor</hi> of the Covenant is partly required of all, and partly is tendered to all; the <hi>tenor</hi> conſiſting (as himſelf declares) of the condition required, and of the benefits tendered; and he may as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally ſay, the <hi>tenor</hi> is <hi>required</hi> of all, as ſay the tenor is <hi>tendered</hi> to all; both being falſe in his ſenſe, and contradictory to his Doctrine.</p>

                  <hi>Page</hi> 211. <hi>He thinks its unſound to hold the Sacrament conveyes real grace morally by way of Obſiguation:</hi> Why I pray? <hi>Becauſe moral inſtruments cannot exhibit any thing real.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If this be true, then how can the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament convey grace by way of <hi>ſignification,</hi> ſince the <hi>Sacrament</hi> (himſelf confeſſing) is <hi>only a moral inſtrument.</hi> And if it convey grace neither by way of <hi>ſignification,</hi> nor of <hi>obſignation,</hi> nor of <hi>exhibition,</hi> it conveyes grace no way. Thus by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his principles the Sacrament conveyes no grace at all; and if ſo, then it neither converts, or edifies, which how abſurd? yea, <hi>pari ratione,</hi> how doth the word convert, ſince it alſo is but a moral inſtrument?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Grace is not ſtrengthned, but by ſuper-added degrees (I mean ordinarily) but grace is ſtrengthned by the <hi>ſealing,</hi> as well as by the <hi>ſignifying</hi> virtue of the Sacrament, therefore degrees of grace are <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> conveyed by the <hi>ſealing</hi> power of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:120105:207"/>
The <hi>major</hi> is firm till Mr. <hi>H.</hi> can ſhew ſome other way of ſtrengthning grace <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> (for of that ſtrength I now ſpeak) beſides ſuperadded degrees. The <hi>minor</hi> is proved by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Sacrament is a Seal, aſſures the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to <hi>faith;</hi> by this aſſurance <hi>faith</hi> is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as was <hi>Abrahams</hi> by the Seal of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. Faith is not confirmed but by <hi>intention;</hi> an habit is not <hi>intended</hi> but by degrees ſuperadded. The concluſion then will follow, That degrees of grace are conveyed by the <hi>ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> power of the Sacrament; and becauſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament works only <hi>morally,</hi> therefore they are conveyed by it <hi>morally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I doubt not but the Sacrament may beget grace; but the Queſtion in diſpute is, whether every Sacramental action doth ſo, and particularly the act of <hi>receiving;</hi> for till Mr. <hi>H.</hi> proves this, he is ſtill at a loſs, and while he would charge me, <hi>p.</hi> 212. <hi>as being injurious to poor Chriſtians, diſvaluing this means of grace, bringing in queſtion how it can beget any degree of grace at all</hi> (a charge to which, I truſt, I can grounded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plead not guilty) himſelf is found guilty of his own charge, by <hi>denying the Sacrament conveyes real grace morally;</hi> as I have ſhewed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Paragraph.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> H. <hi>p.</hi> 212. <hi>I agree with him as for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; but for the intelligent,</hi> Johns <hi>Baptiſm may convince</hi> him, whom we finde admitting <hi>all to it, and then exhorting them to amendment, as the uſe or end of it, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If Baptiſm be a converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, I ſee no reaſon why Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhould <hi>ſuſpend</hi> Infants any more from its efficacy than from its
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:120105:208"/>
uſe. And to what purpoſe are Infants baptized, if they are <hi>(in ſtatu quo)</hi> capable of no good by it? eſpecially thoſe of them who dye within few hours or dayes after Baptiſm. They were rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively holy, and ſo members of the Church (in the right of their parents) before Baptiſm, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. as in hereditary Kingdoms, the Heir upon the death of his Father, is King before his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His argument drawn from their <hi>non</hi>-intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſeems as ſtrong againſt their edification or confirmation by Baptiſm, as againſt their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and regeneration by it, ſince the baptized In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant can underſtand no more in order to his edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, than in order to his regeneration by his Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Therefore (with ſubmiſſion) I rather appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, That Baptiſm being a Divine Ordinance, doth undoubtedly attain all its ends for good in the elect veſſels of mercy, be they Infants or grown perſons; and that either in their Infancy, or when they come to riper years.</p>
               <p>Upon ſuppoſition that it is a converting Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, I ſee no abſurdity in it if we ſay, it may (at the very moment of Baptizng) be morally inſtrumental to convert the Infant-baptized, not by way of ſignification to the apprehenſion of the Babe, who can underſtand nothing of it (nor is it neceſſary he ſhould underſtand; man cannot get into the heart, but by the head, God needs not that porch or threſhold) but by way of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural concourſe with this, as with other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances when ever they become effectual. Chriſt at the very moment when the Miniſter baptizes the Babe with water, can baptize it with the Holy Ghoſt, and powr grace into its heart as
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:120105:208"/>
the Miniſter powrs water upon his face, the childe being equally paſſive both in the ſign, &amp; in the thing ſignified, and underſtanding nothing of either. If an Infant may be bewitched by a Diabolical Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony uſed by the Devils miniſters, and that Witchery be removed by a ſpell, or the like, which the Babe cannot underſtand (and if he could, the underſtanding avails not to its efficacy) why may not the ſame Babe be regenerated by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ceremony applyed to it by Gods Miniſter? the Devil in things of this nature being but Gods Ape. How did <hi>Jordan</hi> cure the Leper? 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 14. How did <hi>Peters</hi> ſhadow cure the ſick? <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 15. How did <hi>Pauls</hi> handkerchiefs both cure diſeaſes, and caſt out Devils? <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 12. All theſe were but ſigns and ſeals of Gods mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous preſence. And why may not God (when he pleaſes) concur ſupernaturally with Baptiſm, in order to Regeneration, as he concurred with <hi>Jordan,</hi> a Shadow, or Handkerchief, in order to cure or diſ-poſſeſſion? I believe Divine concourſe is much after this nature in every Ordinance when ſavingly effectual. And Baptiſm applyed to an Infant, or to a man, is but as <hi>Pauls</hi> handkerchief was to an Infant, or to a man. The man might underſtand this handkerchief came from <hi>Pauls</hi> body, and would be effectual to heal him; this the Infant could not underſtand, yet the effect of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followed alike in both. Nor was the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief more powerful to heal the man, becauſe he was intelligent; but poſſibly his intelligence might prove a bar, he being thereby capable of an act of unbelief, which might hinder the cure, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 58. and 17. 19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 6. and 9. 23, 24. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 9. which actual unbelief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:120105:209"/>
are not capable of. Thus the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hath a natural aptitude to illuminate the minde with common knowledge of Chriſt, but never of it ſelf can work a ſaving underſtanding or regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, this being wholly in Gods power. We muſt therefore extend the notion of a moral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument further than M. <hi>H.</hi> doth; that being truly a moral inſtrument, not onely which works by way of ſignification to my underſtanding, but that alſo upon which being uſed, an effect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde follows, by way of compact, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whether I underſtand it or not. Thus a Witch is the moral cauſe of a childes death, but the Devil is the phyſical cauſe thereof, he apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his natural power (by Gods permiſſion, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Witches uſing of his ceremonies for that purpoſe) to kill the childe. And thus the Miniſter and Ordinances are the moral inſtruments of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but God is the phyſical, or rather hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Nor do we by this doctrine deviate to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh <hi>opus operatum;</hi> but honor Gods Liberty, Soveraignty and Grace, who when he pleaſeth concurs with his Ordinances ſupernaturally, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Converſion and Regeneration wrought then infallibly, and not otherwiſe. And certainly, if Baptiſm be a converting Ordinance, why may not Infants thus be converted by it as well as elder perſons? eſpecially when at the hour of Baptiſm, faith and devotion are upon the wing in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Friends, Gods people, and the Miniſter, aſſembled to wreſtle with God, that he would pleaſe to waſh the childe in the Laver of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, &amp;c. whence publike Baptiſms are more eligible than private Baptiſms. And thus upon
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:120105:209"/>
the ſuppoſition, it may alſo be effectual to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent perſon baptized; yet not ſimply becauſe he is intelligent, but becauſe of Gods ſupernatural concourſe in him, as well as in the Infant, the work of Converſion being ſupernatural in every ſubject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas M. <hi>H.</hi> ſays, <hi>ib. John firſt bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the people, and then exhorted them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If his meaning be excluſive, that <hi>John</hi> did not exhort to repentance before, but onely after Baptiſm, I believe he will finde little favor from the Text for ſuch an opinion. Its evident, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. that <hi>John</hi> leads them from his Baptiſm to Chriſt, for the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, as a future thing; withal, that he preached to them before he baptized, to me ſeems more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, by comparing verſ. 2, 5, 6, 7. of <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. Beſides, ſuppoſing the exhortation were after Baptiſm, and that ſome were converted upon the place, the great queſtion will be (which ſhews the weakneſs of M. <hi>H.</hi> his inference) whether they were converted by <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, or by his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing exhortation? For his inſtance in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. it is more than M. <hi>H.</hi> can prove, that their faith was onely hiſtorical. Likely, it might be ſo in ſome of them; but what is this to prove that their Baptiſm did convert them (any more than it did <hi>Simon Magus</hi>) who might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be converted by ſome of thoſe Sermons which they heard every day, or hold out in a form of Godlineſs to their dying day, as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> did. The Text ſays, <hi>they were all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> Acts 2. 41. but it doth not ſay, that any of them were converted by Baptiſm.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That this cannot be his meaning (unleſs he miſtake himſelf) is evident by his own Text, <hi>page</hi> 59. of his Vindication, in theſe words, <hi>This grace we receive in the uſe of them, is that which converts ſome, and ſtrengthens others.</hi> Now grace received is not the <hi>divine Act,</hi> which he calls <hi>gratia operans,</hi> but the <hi>terminus</hi> of that action, called <hi>gratia operata,</hi> and which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, doth, formally and immediately convert, regenerate, and change the heart; of which effect or <hi>terminus</hi> the word preached is the moral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, but God as creating and infuſing is the principal cauſe: and as the <hi>divine action</hi> is really diſtinct from the <hi>terminus</hi> wrought by it, ſo the <hi>divine action</hi> is not <hi>receptible,</hi> but only its <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> namely the habits of grace. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſtrongly againſt Mr. <hi>H.</hi> (by his own expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of himſelf) that the Ordinances as they are primarily and directly means of grace, ſo they are primarily and directly (not remotely) means of converſion, they being the primary and direct means of <hi>grace received,</hi> which <hi>grace received is nothing</hi> elſe but the habits of grace infuſed, not the <hi>divine action</hi> of creating and infuſing, for that cannot be received.</p>

2.

               <p>His argument for excluding infants, <hi>Becauſe the Sacrament converts by a joynt virtue of the word and diſcernment, which children have not,</hi> may as well exclude them from Baptiſm, of which they have no more diſcerning than of the Lords Supper.</p>

               <p>M. <hi>H.</hi> ib. <hi>A thing is not good, and our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore God wills it: But God wills it, and therefore it is good, and our duty.</hi>

Some things are eſſentially good, and therefore neceſſarily our duty, as rational Creatures; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the duty of <hi>Loving God,</hi> this is good, and our duty, though there had been no poſitive command to enjoyn it.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Antecedent is true <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> not <hi>in ſenſu compoſito.</hi> Among all Gods Ordinances, ſome are means to beget grace, others to encreaſe grace; but the thing to be proved is, That every Ordmance, yea, every part of an Ordinance, is a means both to beget, and to encreaſe grace; nor can M. <hi>H.</hi> prove, that the act of receiving is a way God would have natural men to walk in. He that ſays, <hi>Receiving</hi> is a Converting-Ordinance, muſt produce, 1. A command for all natural men within the Church to receive. 2. A promiſe of Converſion annexed to that command.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>H.</hi> ib. <hi>You muſt produce ſome Text where converting grace is denyed peculiarly to this means. If any ſay, This is a negative, which ought not to be proved: I anſwer, though it be ſo in the words, yet materially in the thing it is an affirmative; for he that excepts out of a general, affirms a limitation, and muſt prove it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here M. <hi>H.</hi> his Logick fails him. Himſelf as <hi>Opponent</hi> in this place, undertakes to prove, That <hi>receiving</hi> is a Converting-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. I as <hi>Reſpondent,</hi> deny his Antecedent
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:120105:219"/>
(That every Ordinance is Converting, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly thoſe Ordinances which have no promiſe of Converſion annexed to them) doth it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently concern M. <hi>H.</hi> to prove (if he will make good his <hi>minor</hi> or <hi>Antecedent</hi>) that all Ordinances have a promiſe of Converſion annexed to them? It lies indeed upon the <hi>Reſpondent,</hi> to grant a true Propoſition, to deny a falſe one, to diſtinguiſh a doubtful one; but it lies onely upon the <hi>Opponent</hi> to prove what he undertakes, unleſs he mean to yield up his cauſe; which in my poor judgement would be more for M. <hi>H.</hi> his comfort and honor. Suppoſe M. <hi>H.</hi> would prove the Sun, Moon and Stars to be means of Converſion, becauſe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us much of God, &amp;c. I as <hi>Reſpondent</hi> anſwer, That is not proof ſufficient, but he muſt produce a promiſe of Converſion annexed to the obſervation of thoſe Heavenly Bodies, if he will make it out, that they are a Converting-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Were it now a reaſonable demand on M. <hi>H.</hi> his part, to bid me produce any one Text of Scripture, where Converting grace is denyed to the Contemplation of the Heavenly Bodies? The caſe is here much alike; nor is every means of Edification, a means of Converſion. True, the <hi>Reſpondent</hi> denying an univerſal Propoſition, and ſo by conſequence affirming a limitation, is bound to give an inſtance for that limitation; but it lies not upon him to prove that inſtance, but upon the <hi>Opponent</hi> to diſprove it. For example, I deny M. <hi>H.</hi> his univerſal (that all Ordinances are Converting) in this denyal, by conſequence I affirm a limitation, and give inſtance of thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances which have no promiſe of Converſion annexed to them. Doth it not here lie upon
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:120105:220"/>
M. <hi>H.</hi> to prove, that every Ordinance hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Converſion annexed to it, if he mean to fortifie his Univerſal? Will any fair <hi>Opponent</hi> here require of me to produce ſome Text, where Converting-grace is denyed to any Ordinance?</p>
               <p>Argument 3.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>H.</hi> p. 229. <hi>There is but a</hi> peradventure <hi>for the Converſion of any in the uſe of all means beſides, becauſe there is no ſpecial promiſe of grace in the beſt uſe of meer naturals: But there is,</hi> an it may <hi>be granted by our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites, to the Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a wide difference between the firſt and ſecond <hi>it may be;</hi> the firſt <hi>it may be,</hi> or <hi>peradventure,</hi> flowing from Gods ordinate power, as declared by his revealed will, that it ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with ſome Ordinances for the Converſion of his: the ſecond <hi>it may be,</hi> flowing onely from his abſolute power, which is a poor ground of encouragement to expect Converſion from any ſtanding Ordinance, to which God hath annexed no promiſe of Converſion. Its poſſible, by Gods abſolute power, the damned may be ſaved through the ſatisfaction of Chriſt; but by Gods ordinate power, its poſſible onely for the Living to be ſaved. The former <hi>it may be,</hi> ſpeaks no comfort to the Damned, but the latter <hi>it may be,</hi> ſpeaks much comfort to the living, eſpecially thoſe under the means of grace. Why? Becauſe the efficacy of Chriſts ſatisfaction, is by promiſe annexed to divers of the living, but to none of the damned. In like manner, its poſſible, by Gods abſolute power, <hi>receiving</hi> may convert, not ſo by Gods
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:120105:220"/>
ordinate power, unleſs a promiſe can be produced which annexes converſion to actual receiving. There is a wide difference, I hope, between theſe two <hi>it may bees.</hi> It may be God may convert me occaſionally by my ſin (as he did divers of the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifiers of Chriſt) but it were madneſs thence to conclude that ſin is a means of converſion. <q rend="inline">By ſaying therefore, that actual receiving cannot convert any;</q> I do not limit the Spirit of God, but onely declare that the Spirit is pleaſed to limit himſelf not to convert any by <hi>receiving,</hi> and that becauſe he wills not to convert any by it: And that God wills not to convert any by this, as well as by other Ordinances, I conclude, becauſe God hath not revealed his will to convert any by this, as by other Ordinances. Let it appear, that God wills to convert any by receiving, and I ſhall eaſily be of M. <hi>H.</hi> his judgement, That actual receiving is a converting Ordinance.</p>
               <p>For his amplification, <hi>ib.</hi> by a diſtinction of <hi>an half promiſe, and a full promiſe.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe half promiſes are made to none but ſuch as attend upon God, in, and under the means of converſion; and that actual receiving is a means of converſion, is the Queſtion to be proved.</p>
               <p>Argument 4.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> p. 230: <hi>If the Sacrament be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it is a viſible word, then it muſt be converting as it is a guſtable, tactible word, &amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The precepts of God are lively and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the offers of grace are the means and conveyances of that power we have not in our ſelves to receive it: But here is this moſt ſweet and gracious offer and command, Take and eat.</hi> Ergo:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The reclayming of a man from ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vice, or vices, is a good ſtep forwards towards repentance and converſion: But the Sacrament is a conſtant experiment hereof.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſtep towards repentance materially, and repentance it ſelf. In the Devils and damned, there
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:120105:221"/>
are ſome ſteps towards repentance, as conviction, fear, &amp;c. Yet they, I hope, are far enough from repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man may turn from one ſin to another, from prodigality to covetouſneſs, is this a ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repentance or converſion?</p>
               <p n="3">3. That receiving the Sacrament reclaims a natural man from any ſin is ſtill the Queſtion begged. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> pretends conſtant experience, but names here no experiment.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This reſolution of his is either againſt drunkenneſs alone, which is purely carnal, upon carnal principles, and is often juſtly plagued with returning to the vomit; or it is againſt all other ſins too; and this either a velleity and faint reſolution, made by the ſtrength of natural free will; or real and ſincere: the former is but a good mood, or <hi>turning upon the hinges,</hi> Prov. 26. 14. expoſing him to a more dangerous fall; the latter is true repentance begun, and ſuch a one comes not a natural man to the Sacrament, but is converted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore receiving.</p>

Argument 7.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> 231. <hi>The acting or exerciſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace, and endeavouring to do what a man can, is another good ſtep forward towards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: But the Sacrament is the means to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe common grace in the unregenerate.</hi> Ergo.</p>

               <p>M. <hi>H.</hi> ib. <hi>The ſolemn ingagement of the ſoul to Chriſt upon his terms, &amp;. is a

Nor can any expect the Spirits acting out of the way and road of the Spirit.

               <p>Argument 9.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>H.</hi> p. 232. <hi>That which can beget more degrees of the ſame grace, can beget the firſt grace, unleſs theſe degrees are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſome other way than that is. But all grace (firſt and ſecond) is begotten alike, by
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:120105:223"/>
propounding the object, by illumination, and by a touch upon the will; which object is ſhewed forth in the Sacrament, as in the Word, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. M. <hi>H.</hi> anſwers himſelf by his own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, ſince the firſt grace is ever begot by ſupernatural infuſion; not ſo alwayes the ſecond, but may be got by exerciſe of the firſt grace, the Holy Ghoſt concurring to excite, and act the principle received, but not alwayes inſuſing new grace, as God firſt powred down fire from heaven, which afterward was preſerved and increaſed by the Prieſts applying fuel, &amp;c. <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 12. This truth is held forth by the Parables of the Talents and Pounds, which were at firſt given by the Lord, but improved and increaſed by the ſervants induſtry. As moral habits are ſtrengthned by moral acts, ſo ſpiritual habits are ſtrengthned by ſpiritual acts. Light may be intended by reflection or refraction, but cannot at firſt be generated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a direct beam; Such is the firſt grace darted into the ſoul by the Holy Ghoſt, but afterwards intended by exerciſe, and multiplied acts as ſo many reflections and refractions, though withall the Holy Ghoſt may at pleaſure dart in freſh beams of grace, as the Lord did often-times cauſe fire to fall from heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Think you the Prieſts or other Overſeers were to admit none to the Paſſover, but thoſe whom they knew to be clean? yet the rule was ſtrict, <hi>No unclean perſon ſhall eat thereof:</hi> Whence I infer, As the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their rule obliged not them to know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who were clean, who unclean; ſo the ſtrictneſs of the Goſpel-rule (let no unregenerate man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) obliges not Church-Officers to know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, who are regenerate, who not; but onely to take care, that no perſons viſibly unclean in an Evangelical ſenſe, be admitted to the Sacrament.

What need they ſuſpect every man himſelf on the Paſſeover Even, if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his aſſertion be true, that but two dayes before the Traytor was ſo particularly diſcovered by the Sop given unto him? Its more probable therefore, that Chriſt at one and the ſame time, and that before the Sacrament, did diſcover <hi>Judas</hi> in general by his dipping in the diſh; and in particular by the Sop given him, <hi>John</hi> 13. 26. and by word of mouth alſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 25.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. p.</hi> 67. <hi>Johus Sop was before the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Matthews dipping was at the very time of accompliſhing it.</hi>

truely <hi>before</hi> as two dayes <hi>before?</hi> If Chriſt waſhed his Diſciples feet, &amp;c. between the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſupper, and the Paſſeover, I hope it was as truly done <hi>before</hi> the Paſſeover as if he had waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them two dayes <hi>before</hi> the Paſſeover; and the Sop being given at that time, it ſeems conſonant to reaſon, and not againſt Scripture, that <hi>Judas</hi> went away before the Paſſeover, much more before the Lords Supper, to acquaint the Prieſts with that fair opportunity of taking our Saviour in the Garden that very night if they would furniſh him with a ſufficient number to attach him; compare <hi>John</hi> 18. v. 2. 3. with <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 30. which, if ſo, aggravates <hi>Judas</hi> his malice, who out of deſign to kill the true Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. forſook and ſleighted the typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Paſſeover.</p>

                  </gap>) is not mentioned by <hi>Luke</hi> in the original, but onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the Tranſlators, which makes it prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough that <hi>Luke</hi> obſerved not ſo much the order of time, as the truth of the narrative here, as elſewhere. <hi>Luke</hi> tells you that Satan entred, <hi>John</hi> ſpecifies the time, immediately after the Sop gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; which Sop, I proved a little above, was given on the Paſſeover even, after the common ſupper. Yea, <hi>page</hi> 67. of his Vindication Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges that many learned men think there were three Suppers on the Paſſeover Even, which
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:120105:231"/>
though he is pleaſed to term <hi>conjectures,</hi> yet we need not be afraid to ballance his conjecture with their conjectures. His pronouncing <hi>(tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam è tripode) that they have erred, and are not to be built upon,</hi> I hope is no oracle: Nor well his Argument hold againſt them though <hi>Judas</hi> were at the Table (which was firſt a common table, then a Paſſeover table, and laſtly the Lords Table) unleſs he can prove that <hi>Judas</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at all the three Suppers upon the ſame Table. Onely I muſt confeſs his laſt Argument, <hi>ib.</hi> is wonderful, as being drawn from <hi>Johns</hi> ſilence; thus, <hi>John ſayes nothing of this Supper at all; Ergo, Judas</hi> received the Lords Supper. Should we now imitate Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and argue, <hi>John</hi> ſayes nothing of the Lords Supper; <hi>Ergo, Judas</hi> did not receive; might not the Reader from ſuch profound arguments conclude (with a ſmile) that both of us were rare Logicians? Nor will it follow (with M. <hi>H.</hi> his good leave) that becauſe Chriſt offers grace to all, therefore the ſigns of grace muſt be tendered to all, or received by all.

Unworthy receiving is not ſimply an omiſſion, but a commiſſion, and a preſumptuous act of him that will venture to receive when prohibited; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which account it is more damnable than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy praying, &amp;c. ſince no man in what eſtate ſoever, is prohibited to pray.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are, or are not according to the nature of the moral work. He that doth a work naturally moral, yet unworthily (<hi>caeteris pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>) ſins leſs than he that doth a work moral by inſtitution unworthily, though he can convert himſelf by neither. The reaſon is, becauſe all men are commanded works really moral, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in doing them a wicked man ſins only in the manner; but divers perſons are prohibited ſome parts of inſtituted worſhip, who therefore by venturing upon them, ſin both for matter and manner: Of this nature was the Paſſeover, and now is the Lords Supper as received.

               <p>Object. <hi>We ſcruple not the thing, but the doing of it in order to</hi> ſuſpenſion.</p>
               <p>

When you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to Church-officers, can you not tell them you ſeek not the Suſpenſion, but the reformation or Excommunication of the offending Brother? I wiſh we had more ſcruplers of ſuſpenſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that in love and humility Church-members would make conſcience of the forementioned duties. But this is our miſery, and one great bar to Reformation, that private Chriſtians make little conſcience either of fraternal correption, or of telling the Church when private admonition will not do. <note place="margin">His very words are <hi>p.</hi> 262. <hi>if they do not their beſt to hinder him from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, which yet is not ſimply a duty, but onely</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid, <hi>in reference to the parties amendment as the end, and excommunication as the means, &amp;c.</hi> Doth he not here grant, that its our duty <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> to endeavor to hinder an intelligent Church-member from the Sacrament, in reference to excommunication? <hi>mark it,</hi> he ſays, not to hinder him from receiving by excommunication, but <hi>in reference</hi> to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; and what is this, I pray, but by ſuſpenſion to make way for excommunication? a doctrine very agreeable to our principles in ſundry caſes.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. (To return to my Antagoniſt) let the Reader judge, if here M. <hi>H.</hi> yield not up his cauſe, by granting. <hi>That in reference to excommunication,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:120105:245"/>
and the parties amendment, it is my duty to do my beſt to hinder a perſon viſibly unworthy from receiving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hindering from the Sacrament here, cannot be excommunication in M. <hi>H.</hi> his ſenſe, ſince his own text tells us, that this hindring from the Sacrament is <hi>in reference</hi> to excommunication; and ſo it ſeems to explain his doctrine about the ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perſons <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate: And though he ſay, <hi>ib. This hindring is in reference to excommunication, as the means, and in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to amendment as the end,</hi> that will not help him, ſince we eaſily grant, that ſuſpenſion may be, yea ſometimes ought to be, in reference to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, as a ſharp means, but both muſt always be, in reference to reformation, as the end.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We renounce, as well as himſelf, that falſe ground <hi>(Thas unfitneſs to the Sacrament, is the formal cauſe of excommunication)</hi> and judge it a very harſh doctrine. <hi>Groſs</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance makes a man unfit for the Sacrament, which yet is not <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> the formal or juſt cauſe of excommunication in the rigour, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>affected</hi> ignorance may be.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If it be our duty to exhort (and in our places to prepare) all our fellow-members to come worthily (I know no duty incumbent to exhort any to come abſolutely) to the Lords-Supper; ſure Church-Officers act not out of their place, by endeavoring to prepare Church-members for the Sacrament, by previous tryal, counſel, and exhortation.

Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the people to this, and you will be a better friend to reformation than by pleading for your free admiſſion.<note place="margin">I mean not, that publick preaching is ſo the Miniſters work as to excuſe him from private converſe with his flock.

               <p>Mr. <hi>H. p.</hi> 262. <hi>Suppoſe a regenerate man deſerves to be excommunicate, and I do not complain of him; he comes, and receives in faith. Now if I muſt partake of a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving unworthily, when I ſhould endeavour his excommunication, and do not, then I must partake in this mans receiving worthily, and ſo my not endeavouring their excommunication ſhall be good in the one, and ſin in the other. It is apparent therefore, that this ſin is to be ſingled by it ſelf; I am never the more or the leſs guilty whether he come or not come, receives worthily, or not worthily; that is</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>but this is one only continued guilt in me, that I do not my duty in admoniſhing, and telling the Church of him, ſuppoſing the caſe ſo, that it is my duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Grant Mr. <hi>H.</hi> His ſuppoſition may be true, what then?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. Then by my not endeavouring his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, I muſt partake of his receiving worthily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No ſuch matter, for his worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (upon the ſuppoſition) is but accidental unto your neglect of duty; and as a ſin following acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally in another upon my duty performed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:120105:246"/>
him ſhall not be imputed to me (as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon my admonition my Brother grow worſe) ſo a moral good following upon the neglect of my duty, ſhall not be imputed to me, who omitted that duty; but <hi>contra,</hi> the neglect of my duty ſhall be charged upon me. God meaſures not a ſin or duty by its accidental events, but firſt by its nature and circumſtances; and ſecondly, by its natural and proper conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents. He that omits good that good may come thereby (by <hi>good</hi> underſtand my duty, that I am <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> obliged to) ſins, as well as he that does evil that good may come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p>What next? Mr. <hi>H. And ſo my not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring their excommunication, ſhall be good in the one and a ſin in the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is as wilde as the former, and ſuppoſes that an omiſſion of duty is warranted by a moral good following caſually thereupon.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore anſwer this ſuppoſition with another. Suppoſe, I am dangerouſly ſick of a feaver; the Phyſician forbids me wine: a careleſs Nurſe (contrary to the Phyſicians prohibition) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my importunity lets me drink Sack liberally, upon which I fall a ſleep for divers hours together, and recover: Will Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſay the Nurſes careleſneſs was <hi>morally</hi> good becauſe it was eventually good? <hi>Pilates</hi> not reſcuing of Chriſt was eventually good, was it therefore mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good? In like manner, Suppoſe a godly man deſerving excommunication receive worthily; his worthy receiving is accidental to my neglect of telling the Church; wherefore by omiſſion of that my duty I am guilty as if he had received unworthily; that, and not his worthy receiving
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:120105:246"/>
being the natural and proper fruit of my omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Yet further; Who ever will ſeriouſly weigh and compare the ſuppoſition and inference, may obſerve that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is no very cordial friend to excommunication, how ever he may cry it up, to cry down ſuſpenſion.</p>
               <p>With all, leſt I ſhould ſeem to be over rigid, I muſt adde. That if this godly man deſerved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication for ſome foul crime known onely to me, or ſome few, and upon reproof humbled himſelf, &amp;c. I dare not ſay its my duty (in that caſe) to tell the Church, ſince the principal end of excommunicating this perſon is attained by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reproof, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15. But in caſe this godly man do obſtinately perſiſt, and deny, or defend the crime that is evident, there is little hope that in ſuch a condition, he will receive wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily; yet ſuppoſe he ſhould, that will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my neglect to tell the Church upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy after admonition firſt by my ſelf, and then with two or three more according to the rule. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. By all hath been ſaid, its appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, my ſin of omiſſion is not to be ſingled by it ſelf (as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would have it) and that I am more guilty if that godly man receive unworthily, than if he had not received at all; ſince my telling the Church (in caſe he be obſtinate) might have prevented his great ſin of unworthy receiving, to which I am acceſſory by not hindring it when I might, and ſhould; but his unworthy receiving will not excuſe my neglect to tell the Church, ſince his worthy receiving (upon the ſuppoſition) is not the proper, but accidental conſequent of that my neglect and omiſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:120105:247"/>To what Mr. <hi>H.</hi> addes in the ſame page, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, We ſay not its <hi>abſolutely</hi> a duty to keep from the Sacrament perſons viſibly unworthy (this act being limitable by ſeveral cautions) but that it concerns Church-members, by private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, or telling the Church, to ſeek the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of ſuch a perſon; which regularly done frees private Chriſtians from guilt. Nor is there the ſame reaſon for keeping any from the Word and Prayer, as from the Sacrament.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> By <hi>relative</hi> cutting off from Church-communion in generall, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> means (to my beſt underſtanding) That a perſon thus cenſured hath no <hi>relative</hi> right to any Church-Ordinance; yet by the Churches indulgence may be admitted to any, though not as a Church-member. Whence it follows, That he who is no Church-member (ſuch is his excommunicated perſon) may by the Churches indulgence be admitted to any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; which if true (I know no <hi>ſcriptum eſt</hi> for ſuch indulgence) then not onely perſons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, but alſo heathen may be admitted to receive the Lords Supper, though not as Church-members; a great latitude indeed. But I pray, Sir (upon the ſuppoſition) may the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge me a real injoyment of the Sacrament, to which (if excommunicated) I have no relative
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:120105:248"/>
right, and may it not indulge me a relative right to the Sacrament, though at preſent it ſee good reaſon to deny me the real injoyment thereof? Of this formerly, therefore I paſs it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ib. <hi>Not every ſleight occaſion, but notorious crimes, muſt ſerve for Church-cenſure. If we allow any cenſure leſs than ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out of the Church, Church-cenſures are like to become ordinary, and ſoon contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. By conceſſion of the firſt branch; yea, though the crime be heynous (ſo it be not notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and publick) I do not think it muſt come preſently to a Church-cenſure, till private admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition be ſleighted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. v. 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet that may poſſibly be ſleight to ſome, which is very foul in it ſelf, whether you reſpect its ſubſtance or circumſtances: And ſuch is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ignorance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If there be no cenſure leſs than caſting out of the Church, then belike publick reproof is no Church-cenſure. Sure the Apoſtle was not of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his minde, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the cauſes of Church-cenſures be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, Church-cenſures <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> muſt be as ordinary. That frequency makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible is too true through our innate corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which inclines us to contemn Chriſt, the choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Ordinances and mercies, becauſe they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary. But thence to argue it were better ſuch mercies and Ordinances were leſs frequent, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſcriptural and irrational.</p>
               <p n="1">For his perſonal reflections, <hi>page</hi> 267-269. I ſhall onely ſay thus much; I He takes too much upon him to charge me ſo highly, eſpecially with
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:120105:248"/>
                  <hi>malice.</hi> I confeſs I hare his free Admiſſion, but love his perſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What I ſpeak <hi>in theſi,</hi> and ſtill apprehend to be a truth, he firſt applies <hi>in hypotheſi,</hi> and then exaggerates, to make it ſeem more odious.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Had I applied it perſonally to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I only noted what God might juſtly do, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſeth, <hi>p.</hi> 268. and withall acknowledge as much againſt my ſelf, That God juſtly might deal with me as a <hi>weed,</hi> for cheriſhing and tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>weeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His four Queries propounded <hi>page</hi> 269. have formerly been anſwered, therefore I ſhall not trouble my Reader with Repetitions.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H. p.</hi> 269. <hi>And now if Mr.</hi> Drake <hi>ſhall have need to write again; as I beleeve nature will work, and his ſpirit cannot hold: I ſhall deſire him, if he will go to vent that ſuperfluity of maliciouſneſs, &amp;c. to take along with him that Text,</hi> Deut. 23. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> How true is that ſaying of the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 19. <hi>As in water face anſwereth to face?</hi> ſo, &amp;c. Mr. H. hath ſet me ſo fair a copy in his <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> that he might well expect (conſidering both our hearts have the ſame inherent principles of naughtineſs) I would undoubtedly write after his copy. But I hope I have not ſo learned Chriſt. As in placing the <hi>Bar</hi> (if I know my own heart) I was not acted by malice; ſo now in fixing the <hi>Bar,</hi> I have, by the grace of God, endeavoured to avoid the appearance of malice, and ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrew my ſelf, if any paſſage have ſlipt from my Pen, which may favour of that helliſh leaven. I would not only ſeek Truth, but alſo follow after Charity, eſpecially with Mr. <hi>Humphrey.</hi>

Pray, Sir, If you ſhall ſee cauſe of writing again, however you may trample upon Mr. <hi>Drake,</hi> do not abuſe the holy Scripture. Its ill jeſting with ſuch Edge-tools. The Word of Salvation deſerves better at our hands than to be made either an <hi>Object,</hi> or <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of deriſion.</p>
